Located near the Fulton County Airport-Brown Field just outside Atlanta, the $400 million, 1.2-million-square-foot distribution center will be highly-automated and capable of handling more than 100,000 packages an hour, according to a company statement. ,The addition comes as FedEx’s Ground division has added more than 12 million square feet of package-sorting space since last year, including four major distribution hubs and 19 fully-automated facilities. One hub FedEx Ground opened outside Pittsburgh in September is 300,000 square feet and uses automated systems that can handle 15,000 packages an hour. ,The two company’s ground operations, along with the U.S. Postal Service, are the delivery businesses that are growing most rapidly from the surge in online sales. ,“It’s been a growth story,” said Perry Colosimo, a spokesman for FedEx Ground. For fiscal year 2017, FedEx Ground plans to invest $2 billion on real estate, facilities and handling equipment. The new facilities “are designed for high-throughput sortation, minimized handlings, and more direct loading that will increase the speed, efficiency and reliability,” Mr. Colosimo said.,Satish Jindel, president of industry research firm SJ Consulting Group Inc., said the new, larger parcel facilities allow high-volume shippers like , , to bring more packages to delivery hubs closer to customers, allowing for faster delivery. ,“E-commerce is causing a change in supply chains, where bigger shippers want to drop their shipments deeper into the delivery networks rather than go through many different stops and through big hubs,” Mr. Jindel said. “That way the final delivery is faster and more dependable. Service problems in parcel delivery usually come not in the destination city but in the cities that packages must go through to get to their final destination.”,Automation helps the parcels move more quickly through the distribution center, Mr. Jindel added. “Instead of Amazon delivering packages to 15 different post offices in Pittsburgh to get overnight delivery, they can go to one FedEx facility and get the same service,” he said., ,Erica E.

Bathed in clouds of white sulfuric gun smoke, the contenders slammed away at point-blank range like armored knights dueling with sledgehammers. The winner would dominate naval warfare into the next century.,The showdown on March 9, 1862,...

She was a sometime secretary, as yet unpublished, and more than a year would pass before she would improvise a bedtime story for her daughter about a cheery, anarchic little redhead named Pippi Longstocking. ,As war raged, Lindgren was moved to document events in a leather-bound diary into which she also pasted...

On the Road With Dylan,," Robbie Robertson, the lead guitarist and main songwriter of the Band, is in the unenviable position of never having been much of a singer. (He posits asthma as a factor.) Luckily, the Band was blessed with three of the greatest vocalists of the rock era (Rick Danko, Richard Manuel and Levon Helm), who were able to give his beautiful melodies and lyrics their fullest possible emotional expression. In “Testimony,” however, the “voice” is not in question. Robust, wry, gritty and wise to the vicissitudes of a career in rock ’n’ roll, it is just what the reader wants, marred only occasionally by stiff dialogue.,

Why Do We Have Languages?,," Despite its title, Andrea Moro’s “Impossible Languages” is less about languages that don’t exist and more about those that do. Until somewhat recently, he writes, the dominant view was that there were no theoretical constraints on the way languages could develop, in terms of their sound or syntax. Only in the past half-century or so have we realized that all languages “share a unique, intricate set of general principles with relatively little variation.” Mr. Moro’s admirably concise work is a soft introduction to one influential (and much-debated) account of those principles—the theory of generative grammar,...

Patients Aren’t Benefitting From Drug-Cost Savings,,"When the Institute for Clinical and Economic Review recommends insurers pay lower prices and restrict access without passing on savings, it is encouraging higher drug costs and hurting patients (“Drugmakers Go on Offense,” Business & Tech., Nov. 4). A good deal of the increase in drug costs is due to insurance companies and pharmacy benefit managers (PBMs) increasing the amount consumers pay out of pocket and excluding coverage of some medicines outright. Most of the increase in retail prices comes from rebates and discounts...

Time for Warring ‘Tribes’ to Come Together,,"“A Truce for Our Tribal Politics” (Review, Nov. 5) calls for taking steps to bridge our national rift, but until we can accept that we learn much more from listening than from talking, Jonathan Haidt and Ravi Iyer’s suggestions won’t work. Having taught high school and college speech, English and drama for over 50 years, I can attest that listening always gets short shrift. We teach students to write persuasively. Speech classes are devoted almost exclusively to output, not input. It is so much less stressful to talk well than to listen well. And if we go to some form of war, it’s because war is easier than peace,...

To order presentation-ready copies for distribution to your colleagues, clients or customers visit http://www.djreprints.com.,http://www.wsj.com/articles/cmo-today-univision-wins-gawker-media-auction-1471434401, ,: Gawker Media is about to have a new owner: Univision. As The Wall Street Journal reports, the , in a court-administered auction on Tuesday, nabbing the bankrupted digital media company from the clutches of Ziff Davis, which kicked things off with a $90 million “stalking horse” bid but balked when things got too pricey. The sale, which has to be approved later this week at a bankruptcy hearing, comes months after a jury awarded Gawker $140 million in a suit brought by wrestler Hulk Hogan. The proceeds of the sale will go to pay the company’s creditors and cover whatever damages remain after appeal in the Hogan case. For Univision, Gawker Media’s stable of sites – which include Gizmodo, Jezebel and Deadspin – add to its growing collection of digital media properties, like Fusion, the Onion (in which it bought a 40% stake earlier this year) and The Root (which it acquired last year). , ,: It’s become pretty clear that Viacom Inc. and its controlling shareholder, Sumner Redstone’s National Amusements, do not want to go to court to settle their legal problems if they can avoid it. The two sides are once again in ,, the Los Angeles Times and WSJ report. The remaining roadblock doesn’t appear to be what happens to Viacom Chairman and CEO ,Philippe Dauman, (he would exit), or who would replace him for the foreseeable future (COO ,Tom Dooley,) but rather National Amusements’ desire to remove five board members. A , who would get the boot under a deal want to stay on the board for several months after a settlement – perhaps to make for a smooth transition, or perhaps to make it look less like they’re getting the boot. If the two sides don’t hammer out a truce, they’ll wind up exactly where they don’t want to be, courtrooms in Massachusetts and Delaware, come this fall. , ,: ,Donald Trump, might be getting some extra help from a political debate expert ahead of his Sept. 26 clash with ,Hillary Clinton., According to the New York Times, ,Roger Ailes,, the former Fox News chairman who left the company last month amid sexual harassment allegations, ,. Sources told the Times that Mr. Ailes’s assistance could even extend beyond the debates. ,, saying Mr. Ailes has “no formal or informal role in the campaign.” Last month, Mr. Trump told NBC he didn’t want to comment about whether Mr. Ailes would help him out, though he called him a “very, very good person” and “a friend of mine for a long time.” This election season has tested that friendship, particularly during Mr. Trump’s ,. Mr. Ailes has plenty of political experience – he advised Richard Nixon and worked as a debate coach for Ronald Reagan – but his possible entrance into Mr. Trump’s campaign would add even more controversy to the race. , ,: Pinterest is the latest company ,. As WSJ reports, the image-discovery social network has rolled “promoted videos” in a beta program for advertisers, which plops videos from marketers in users’ feeds. Unlike auto-play videos on Facebook, Pinterest video ads play as quickly as people scroll on the page, stopping when scrolling stops. The video spots can run as long as five minutes. It’s somewhat surprising that getting into video took Pinterest this long, given that competitors like Facebook, YouTube and Twitter are competing for a digital video ad market expected to reach nearly $13 billion in 2018. But Pinterest thinks it’s better at knowing what people like, since its users go to the site for specific purposes like cooking tips or wedding ideas. “I think there’s plenty of room for all of us to play, and everybody’s got their strengths,” ,Jon Kaplan,, Pinterest’s head of global sales, told WSJ. ,Donald Trump will begin airing his first TV ads of the general election on Friday in key battleground states like Florida and Ohio. The campaign is stepping up its advertising buying more widely after Sept. 1.

Why You Should Never Tell Someone to Relax,Sue Shellenbarger,"This copy is for your personal, non-commercial use only. To order presentation-ready copies for distribution to your colleagues, clients or customers visit http://www.djreprints.com.,http://www.wsj.com/articles/why-you-should-never-tell-someone-to-relax-1471370408,It’s a paradoxical fact: When someone is getting stressed out, one of the least effective (and perhaps most annoying) things to say is “Relax.”,The directive has exactly the opposite effect on most people. People who instruct a colleague, subordinate or loved one to relax may have good intentions. But it is usually better to resist ordering people to change their emotional state and try a different strategy. If you are on the receiving end of an order to relax, there are countermoves that can keep your blood pressure from soaring higher., ,Anna Runyan, was working hard on a previous job as a consultant several years ago when her boss approached her desk and told her to relax, adding, “you don’t have to be perfect,” says Ms. Runyan of San Diego. ,She felt her face flush with anger. She wanted some acknowledgment of her hard work and tight deadlines, but “he really didn’t understand all the things I was doing,” says Ms. Runyan, founder of ClassyCareerGirl.com, a career and business site for women. “I wanted to shut down.” Afterward, she tried updating her boss more frequently on her workload but left the company the following year.,Relaxing on command is physiologically impossible if “the body is already too acutely stressed to turn it around,” says ,Wendy Mendes,, a professor of emotion at the University of California, San Francisco, and a researcher on stress. While the body responds rapidly to stress, returning to a relaxed state can take 20 to 60 minutes, she says.,Other research shows that trying to hide or suppress an emotion, called “emotion suppression,” typically backfires. When people are told to hide how they feel and try to clamp down on the emotion, “it actually leaks out more,” Dr. Mendes says.,Such misfires can open a deep divide between an employee and a boss. ,Brandon Smith, was extremely stressed on a previous job as a retailing manager years ago, after his boss ordered him on his first day to start laying off several co-workers, says Mr. Smith, now an adjunct professor of business at Emory University in Atlanta. ,When his boss passed his desk and remarked “just settle down, it’s not a big deal,” Mr. Smith says, “I wanted to explode with anger.” He was so shaken that he emerged with a new career purpose. After leaving that job, he earned two master’s degrees, in clinical therapy and business, and became an executive coach and team-building consultant, says Mr. Smith, founder of TheWorkplaceTherapist.com.,Advising someone to relax can mask a variety of motives. The underlying message may be, “I can’t stand the way you’re making me feel, so stop it,” says ,Joseph Burgo,, a clinical psychologist and writer best known for his work on narcissism. ,If it is a loved one giving the order to relax, it may reflect a genuine need—for instance, for calm time together. ,Nina Batson, of Tinton Falls, N.J., sometimes rushes to get laundry and other housework done in the evening after work. If her 13-year-old daughter Tati tells her, “Oh, Mom, relax, slow down,” Ms. Batson stops to watch TV with her for a while, talk, laugh and have a cup of tea, even though she knows it will take her longer to finish the chores. ,If you’re criticized for appearing stressed, pause and take a deep breath before responding, says ,Debra Burdick,, an ,Enfield,, Conn., speaker and author of books on mindfulness. Try not to take it personally, and regard it as a cue to address the underlying problems. ,Consider starting a conversation about reducing the causes of stress, says ,Jordan Friedman,, a New York City stress coach. Acknowledge that you’re feeling the strain, and then add, “It would be great if we could sit down at the beginning of next week and figure out how to make this process less stressful for me and everyone else.”,Also, take a moment to “hold up a mirror and take a look” at whether your style of working might be stressful to others, says ,Nancy Ancowitz,, a New York City presentation and career coach. If so, say thanks for the feedback, and try reducing stress through exercise, more frequent breaks, deep breathing or other techniques. ,Embracing more realistic expectations of yourself can help in some situations. ,Adam Ma, of New York City, a graduate student whose first language is Mandarin, was extremely nervous several years ago when he stepped up to give a presentation to 40 fellow students. He wanted his English to be perfect, and he had memorized rigid rules about maintaining good posture and constant eye contact with listeners. When his professor told him in front of the whole class to “calm down,” Mr. Ma says, at first, “it just made me feel worse.”,But then, “I decided to adjust my expectations to be more comfortable,” he says. He allowed himself to use his notes and to pause now and then to look away from the audience, have a sip of water and take a breath. “I felt such relief,” he says. He felt he made an emotional connection with listeners, who applauded warmly, and he scored an A for the course. ,Mr. Ma, who also works full-time as a project and process manager, says telling colleagues before making a presentation that he is feeling stressed helps him relax and “helps prepare people for what they’re going to get and how they can help me,” he says. “And probably, people will make a couple of jokes, and we will have some laughs.”,

,To help calm someone who is stressed, acknowledge his or her feelings first by saying, “Looks like you’re having a tough day,” Ms. Ancowitz says. Show empathy and ask open-ended questions such as “Tell me what’s going on,” to give the person a chance to talk about his or her feelings. You could acknowledge that it’s been a stressful time for everybody, saying, “Other people are feeling the pressure too. Let’s try to figure this out as a group,” Mr. Friedman says. If a discussion is getting heated, suggest taking a break for a walk, a cup of coffee or lunch. ,In New York City, Glenn Chiarello, who has been a dentist for 30 years, says he never tells his patients to relax, even though most new ones are nervous. “Instead, I become inquisitive. ‘How do you feel about having this work done today?’ ” he says. Most patients start talking, and as he listens, “they do in fact do what we want them to do: They start to relax.”, ,Sue Shellenbarger at , ,

To order presentation-ready copies for distribution to your colleagues, clients or customers visit http://www.djreprints.com.,http://www.wsj.com/articles/cmo-today-comedy-centrals-late-night-headache-1471346960, ,: It was never going to be easy for Comedy Central to top the late-night duo of Jon Stewart and ,Stephen Colbert., And as The Wall Street Journal reports, the network has , its replacement for Mr. Colbert’s show, after about a year-and-a-half of poor ratings. The show’s viewership figures were down 27% from last year and 60% from the final season of “The Colbert Report,” according to Nielsen. “It’s sad it didn’t resonate,” Comedy Central President Kent Alterman said. For a show where politics is a major theme, if you can’t resonate during this election season, it’s probably not going to work out. Still, Mr. Alterman sees upside with Trevor Noah’s “Daily Show,” though that show is down 40% among the key 18-to-49-year-old demographic. “Trevor has hit a new level of ownership of the show,” Mr. Alterman said. For Comedy Central, the challenge isn’t just to put together a strong prime-time lineup, but to contend with a changing late-night landscape where competition for young audiences has ramped up. , ,: On the day that bids were due for Gawker Media, the man that helped drive the digital media company into bankruptcy took something of a victory lap. ,, Silicon Valley billionaire ,Peter Thiel, said he was “proud to have contributed financial support” for wrestler Hulk Hogan, who sued for invasion-of-privacy after Gawker posted a clip of his sex tape online and was awarded $140 million by a Florida jury. “I will support him until his final victory,” Mr. Thiel writes. Journalists on Twitter were especially bemused by Mr. Thiel’s point that, when it comes to a free press that may reveal sensitive, but relevant private information, “it’s not for me to draw the line.” As for the future of Gawker Media, WSJ’s Lukas Alpert reports that Ziff Davis and Univision are expected to be the bidders at the table in Tuesday’s auction.

Internally, Mr. Shine has been “known as an affable and loyal right-hand man” to Mr. Ailes, the story notes. His appointment signals that ,Rupert Murdoch,, who took control of the network himself amid the controversy, won’t be cleaning house at Fox News in the wake of the Ailes scandal. Mr. Shine, a programming executive who worked for the likes of Sean Hannity and Greta Van Susteren, rose at the network by delivering ratings and helping Mr. Ailes navigate tricky situations with anchors and contributors. , ,: When broadcasters carry huge sporting events, there’s no better opportunity to promote their own shows. NBCUniversal is no exception this summer. But as Adweek reports, ads for “The Voice” and “Chicago Med” , so that NBC can meet its audience guarantees to Olympic advertisers amid less than stellar traditional TV ratings. When it comes to selecting when to plug its own shows, “There’s a whole group in Rio managing this as it goes along,” Jeff Bader, president of program planning, strategy and research for NBC Entertainment, told Adweek. NBC only has four weeks between the conclusion of the Olympics and the start of the fall season, so it’s important that the network has the chance to promote its upcoming programming while it commands such a large audience.,Snapchat is buying mobile search startup Vurb for about $110 million. Vurb lets you search for things like restaurants, events or even books based on factors like your location and what’s trending, and share results with friends. [,],Instagram’s new Stories feature is a dead ringer for Snapchat, but it doesn’t seem to be drawing users away from that app just yet. According to Sensor Tower, Snapchat users are still spending more minutes each day on the app than on Instagram. [,],MSNBC is considering giving Brian Williams his own show. The anchor, who was removed from NBC’s “Nightly News” last year after embellishing stories, is expected to anchor an 11 p.m. program wrapping up the day’s campaign news.

Hyperloop Technology to Be Studied as Shipping Tool   ,Erica E. Phillips,"This copy is for your personal, non-commercial use only. To order presentation-ready copies for distribution to your colleagues, clients or customers visit http://www.djreprints.com.,http://www.wsj.com/articles/hyperloop-technology-to-be-studied-as-shipping-tool-1471324403,LOS ANGELES—Hyperloop technology is fast-tracking into the freight sector.,Hyperloop One Inc., one of two companies racing to build the futuristic speed-of-sound transportation technology, announced a new partnership with DP World, one of the world’s largest port-terminal operators.,Hyperloop One and DP World will work together to study the viability of using hyperloop technology to unload ocean-container cargo at the Jebel Ali port in Dubai. Containers would travel swiftly via hyperloop to an inland depot, while minimizing the impact on local surface traffic.,Hyperloop, a concept popularized in recent years by billionaire entrepreneur Elon Musk, is a technology that would transport people or cargo in suspended capsules through miles-long near-vacuum tubes at speeds reaching more than 700 miles, or 1,120 kilometers, an hour.,“We have to be creative to sustain our business,” said ,Sultan Ahmed Bin Sulayem,, chairman and chief executive of DP World, at a news conference at Hyperloop One’s offices in Los Angeles on Monday. “This is a game changer for the terminal handling operation as it is today.”,Dubai’s Jebel Ali port last year handled about the same volume of cargo as the Southern California port complex, which includes the ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach, but it is growing quickly, Mr. Sulayem said. With nearly 8,000 port-related businesses in Dubai, and thousands of vehicles visiting the port each day, he said, “congestion is a way of life.”,The DP World feasibility study will explore design, cost and financing options, and it will include studying the possibility of an offshore, floating hyperloop. That concept would enable containers to be taken from a ship, placed into the tube, then transported directly to an inland hub rather than requiring handling and taking up space on the docks—vastly reducing local congestion and emissions, while freeing up port real estate.,If hyperloop works in Jebel Ali, Mr. Sulayem said, “this will re-engineer our thinking world-wide.” DP World operates 77 cargo terminals in more than 40 countries.,The announcement comes as , are working both to improve efficiency and reduce emissions, after decades of global trade growth have increased traffic congestion and pollution in port-adjacent communities. The Dubai port is one of several where Hyperloop One’s engineers are studying the application of their technology to move cargo. The firm is also conducting freight-related feasibility studies in the U.S., Switzerland and Russia.,“The first hyperloop could easily happen in Dubai,” said Hyperloop One CEO ,Rob Lloyd., While the technology has been discussed widely as a speedy means of passenger transportation, Mr. Lloyd said freight may be the first step.,“Our intuition and discussions with regulators have told us start first with freight,” Mr. Lloyd said. “That’s why we’re pretty excited about these projects.”,In Southern California, where Hyperloop One is based, the firm has teamed up with AECOM and GRID Logistics Inc. to study the feasibility of hyperloop technology at the Ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach, the largest container port complex in the U.S.,Mr. Lloyd said hyperloop technology has advantages over proposed rail-transfer facilities that have recently hit setbacks in Southern California, including , a court battle after the neighboring community objected to the environmental impact.,“The things that prevented BNSF’s project don’t apply to hyperloop,” Mr. Lloyd said. “We could go directly from the dock to hyperloop, to rail yards or the Inland Empire in the future.” The Inland Empire is an area east of Los Angeles that is a popular transportation and logistics hub for goods delivered via the port complex.,Hyperloop One faces other challenges as it seeks to get its technology up and running. In July, Brogan BamBrogan, one of the startup’s co-founders, , and the company in a California state court, alleging mismanagement, breach of fiduciary duty and other mistreatment. The ,, alleging Mr. BamBrogan and three colleagues tried to start their own competing company while at Hyperloop One, breaching nonsolicitation, nondisparagement and confidentiality agreements., ,Erica E.

Home Depot Touts Use of Stores for Online Fulfillment ,Loretta Chao,"This copy is for your personal, non-commercial use only. To order presentation-ready copies for distribution to your colleagues, clients or customers visit http://www.djreprints.com.,http://www.wsj.com/articles/home-depot-touts-use-of-stores-for-online-fulfillment-1471550919, , , is making progress in its effort to fulfill online orders from its stores.,The home improvement retailer said customers are taking advantage of its new options for retrieving their e-commerce orders, including buying goods online that can be delivered from stores, with faster and more accurate delivery estimates. ,About 42% of Home Depot’s online orders and almost 90% of its online returns for the second quarter were handled by its stores, executives said this week as ,, on a 6.6% increase in revenue. ,Many in the retail industry believe fulfilling online orders from physical stores can be provide store owners an advantage over online competitors like , , allowing brick-and-mortar shops to serve as both showrooms and well-located mini-distribution centers. ,But few have been able to handle the so-called omni-channel operation smoothly and profitably—inventory is more difficult to manage in stores than in warehouses, and determining the best source of fulfillment can involve a complicated calculation of timing, labor and shipping costs.,That is in part because inventory in warehouses remain static until a delivery order arrives while merchandise in stores can be moved around by customers and is more difficult to track. If products in one customer order are found in multiple locations, retailers can spend extra dollars to consolidate the merchandise and deliver it as one order. And shipping goods from stores may leave retailers facing stock-outs for customers that are in the stores. ,“The issue is, you have a retail outlet that has to look good, and also has to act like a warehouse. That is a big transition,” said Burt White, vice president of industry supply chains at consulting firm Chainalytics.,

,The questions around online fulfillment are critical for retailers. Although e-commerce represented just 5.6% of Home Depot’s sales in the second quarter, online sales grew 19% over the same quarter a year ago, far ahead of overall sales growth, and amounts to a multi-billion annual business. ,Home Depot says it is aided in part by its existing delivery service, which previously only served in-store customers, and its investment into new order management software. Online purchases can now be delivered from more than 700 stores, faster and with shorter scheduled-delivery windows than previously possible.,“We’re seeing really nice pickup from our customers, who have used buy online deliver from store [and] are coming back and using it a second and third time,” said Home Depot Chief Executive ,Craig Menear, on an earnings call.,But the supply-chain changes are a work in progress, he said. “While we had a strong quarter, as you have heard we are instituting a high degree of change across many areas of the business…There will be learnings and opportunities to refine the process along the way,” he said. “In the quarter we identified several opportunities for improvement, particularly around inventory management and freight handling, which we’re working to address.”,“Some [retailers] are making strides and it’s a good, positive sign,” Mr. White said. Retailers are right to change their supply chains, but “there is still a lot more to do…I don’t think they’re out of the woods.”, ,Loretta Chao at , ,

And HarperCollins Publishers is still eager to publish it, despite Mr. Ailes’s recent ouster as the head of Fox News, another branch of the ,Rupert Murdoch, media empire.,A HarperCollins employee says the publishing house is willing to push ahead with the memoir Mr. Ailes signed on to write four years ago—depending on how frank and compelling the manuscript proves to be when it is submitted.,Meanwhile, , , the parent company of Fox News, continues to investigate accusations of sexual harassment against Mr. Ailes, which includes a lawsuit by a former anchor.,21st Century Fox and , , which owns HarperCollins and The Wall Street Journal, were split in 2013 and still count the Murdoch family as a major shareholder. Mr. Murdoch, who is executive chairman of both companies, assumed the role of chairman and acting chief executive of Fox News after Mr. Ailes resigned July 21.,Long before the controversy broke out, HarperCollins and Robert Barnett, Mr. Ailes’s agent, struck a book deal in 2012, according to the HarperCollins employee familiar with the situation. Mr. Ailes’s memoir was envisioned as a behind-the-scenes tale that blended larger-than-life figures from the worlds of politics, business and media, this person said.,HarperCollins believes that a memoir by Mr. Ailes, who formed deep ties to the Republican establishment before building the leading cable news network, has plenty of potential commercial appeal, even though it is unclear how much Mr. Ailes would be able to say about his recent resignation.,“This book has so much potential,” said the HarperCollins employee. “But you can’t publish it in the middle of all this uncertainty. The legal process has to run its course, as does the election. You need time, space and perspective. Books by celebrity authors get delayed all the time.”,Mr. Ailes told the Hollywood Reporter last year that he was writing his memoir for HarperCollins because he didn’t want his son “to have to collect a bunch of , , articles to see what I was like.”,His situation changed dramatically in July. ,, alleging that she was fired after rejecting his sexual advances and complaining about a hostile work environment.

DP World Slows Capacity Growth on Trade Uncertainty ,Nikhil Lohade,"This copy is for your personal, non-commercial use only. To order presentation-ready copies for distribution to your colleagues, clients or customers visit http://www.djreprints.com.,http://www.wsj.com/articles/dp-worlds-first-half-profit-surges-1471504623,DUBAI—Dubai-based global ports operator DP World on Thursday said it has slowed the addition of new capacity amid an ,for trade growth, despite posting a 50% jump in first-half profit on the back of acquisitions. ,“The challenging market conditions of 2015 have continued into 2016 with currency volatility, weak commodity prices and geopolitical issues contributing to uncertainty in domestic demand,” said ,Sultan Ahmed Bin Sulayem,, the group’s chairman and chief executive, resulting in “overall weak global throughput growth.” ,The company said, for example, it has delayed capacity expansion at its flagship port at ,Jebel Ali,, after it handled less cargo during the first half. ,“We retain the flexibility to bring on extra capacity in line with demand,” Mr. Sulayem said. ,DP World is among the world’s largest ports operators, managing 77 marine and inland terminals across six continents. ,But some of the world’s biggest ports are ,from weaker growth in global trade, which expanded just 2.8% in 2015, according to the World Trade Organization—the fourth consecutive year below 3% growth. And trade growth is expected to remain sluggish in 2016, the WTO said in April. ,DP World’s net profit for the six-month period climbed to $608 million from $405 million a year earlier. ,Revenue rose 10.2% year over year to $2.1 billion, helped by the acquisitions of Jebel Ali Free Zone in the United Arab Emirates and the Prince Rupert terminal in Canada. DP World also added new capacity in markets such as Yarimca in Turkey, Stuttgart in Germany and Antwerp Inland in Belgium. ,Without the additional capacity, on a like-for-like basis, its net profit was up 4.3% on the year and revenue grew 2.5%, DP World said. ,“The more modest like-for-like earnings growth is a reflection of the challenging trade environment,” Mr. Sulayem said. “We remain focused on delivering relevant new capacity in the right markets through disciplined investment, improving efficiencies and managing costs to drive profitability.” ,In July, DP World announced an ,a container terminal on Canada’s east coast, allowing the company to compete with U.S. ports on the Atlantic coast for container shipping trade. It also , to develop a port terminal in Taiwan to help expand in the Asia-Pacific region. ,DP World ,the volume of containers it handled in the first half increased 2.5% year over year, supported by growth in its operations in Europe and India, while conditions in Australia and Latin America remained challenging. ,The company was also affected by a slowdown at its Jebel Ali port, which handled 7.4 million standard-sized containers, down 6% year-over-year, reflecting a decline in lower-margin cargo. ,It has now delayed 1.5 million twenty-foot equivalent units (TEU) of capacity expansion at Jebel Ali’s Terminal 3 into 2017 and slowed the expansion of Terminal 4, DP World said.,Dubai’s Jebel Ali port serves as a key gateway to the Middle East and Africa markets, where some economies are slowing. ,The oil-exporting countries of the Persian Gulf, especially, are witnessing a slowdown in growth as the governments there reduce spending at home to cope with dwindling income from energy sales. Dubai, which is part of the U.A.E., has a relatively more diversified economy in the region and is expecting a bump in growth as it , the World Expo in 2020. ,“Our flagship port continues to operate at high levels of utilization and we believe the medium-term outlook remains positive, particularly with the lead up to Expo 2020,” Mr. Sulayem said. ,DP World said it continues to invest in high-quality long-term assets, with capital expenditure of $586 million across the portfolio during the first half. Its capex guidance for 2016 remains unchanged at $1.2 to 1.4 billion with planned investments that include Jebel Ali, London Gateway and Prince Rupert.,“Looking ahead to the second half of the year, we expect throughput performance to improve,” Mr. Sulayem said. , ,Nikhil Lohade at , ,

The Luxe Cycling Tour in Japan That Will Make You a Better Rider,,"This copy is for your personal, non-commercial use only. To order presentation-ready copies for distribution to your colleagues, clients or customers visit http://www.djreprints.com.,http://www.wsj.com/articles/the-luxe-cycling-tour-in-japan-that-will-make-you-a-better-rider-1471531394,As I pedal past rice paddies, blooming camellias and dairy farms, a few last cherry blossoms speckle my arms and legs. But my eyes are on Atsuhito Wakasugi’s hands as I ride behind him through the mountainous forests and farms of Nasu in Japan’s Tochigi Prefecture. While it’s customary for a lead rider to point out cracks or fallen branches on the road, this 26-year-old former professional racer does it with such athletic grace—his wrist rotating languidly, each upturned finger waggling gently—that he might as well be sculpting a vase from clay. Never mind that we’re hurtling downhill at 25 mph. ,On a first trip to Japan last April, my wife and I visited the Niki Club resort, two hours by bullet train and private shuttle north of Tokyo. While she spent her days strolling the 34-acre grounds, indulging in its spa and investigating the complex’s pottery and glassmaking studios, I went on its “Niki Ride.” Introduced in 2012 by resident cyclist ,Mami Matsuura, (who also teaches the resort’s cooking classes), the program offers guided bike rides along some of the region’s best country roads but goes well beyond simply sightseeing. The Niki Ride program is designed for cyclists of any level, covering everything from riding form to training methods and group cycling etiquette. ,I met Mr. Wakasugi the first morning after breakfast (firefly squid, baby sardines, homemade tofu and honey-flavored pickled plums). When not leading rides, he’s general manager of the local professional cycling team, Nasu Blasen. I’d requested a road bike instead of the hybrids the resort keeps, and the one he brought me was a beauty, a Japanese-made carbon-fiber Boma RS-I, the only brand his team races. After making preliminary adjustments to our bikes and stretching, we hit the road, as the songbirds cleared out of our path. There were just the two of us riding, with Ms. Matsuura and a driver trailing behind us in a support vehicle, a heavily decaled Subaru. (She joined us whenever we stopped.) ,
        ,We passed farmhouses, towering cedar groves. We pedaled by the bullet-train tracks, clocking in at 35 mph.,
      ,Communication was strained; I quickly learned I was Niki Ride’s first non-Japanese speaking customer. Ms. Matsuura spoke English fairly well, Mr. Wakasugi less so. But whatever was lost in translation was made up for by seeing this part of Japan with a pair of cyclists who seemed to know it inside out, made terrifically expressive travel companions and brought an unusual amount of happiness to their job.,Mr. Wakasugi’s happiness seemed especially evident each time we approached a hill. “Two-hundred meter climb! Eight-hundred meter climb!” he would call out. We passed farmhouses, wildflower-flecked fields, steep valley overlooks, towering cedar and bamboo groves and a Teddy Bear Museum (a sponsor of the team). “Two kilometers up, plus another kilometer really up!” Mr. Wakasugi would occasionally warn me before the road got even steeper.,The first morning, we rode for nearly four hours, covering 39 miles, stopping at a highway rest stop for some local delicacies (like “taiyaki,” red snapper-shaped pastries filled with red-bean paste or cream). Then after lunch back at the resort—pasta with firefly squid in a mustard-leaf sauce, and chocolate bicycles for dessert—we headed out again. This time, we stopped at a shrine where the 17th-century poet Matsuo Bashō had written haikus to willow leaves and at a bridge across a riverbed, where dozens of 50-foot-long flying carp wind socks dangled in the breeze. Then it was our chance to fly too, as we pedaled by the bullet-train tracks, clocking in at 35 mph., , The Shinkansen bullet train takes 69 minutes from Tokyo Station to Nasushiobara. A 30-minute taxi , or the Niki Club’s shuttle will take you to the resort., , The minimalist Niki Club resort has 44 rooms, including 24 mini-apartments designed by Terence Conran for extended stays and 14 suites by architect Takashi Sugimoto with heated red-pine floors and walls of glass (,. The neighboring Art Biotop glass and ceramic studio offers 20 simpler and less-expensive accommodations, and frequently hosts resident artists ,. ,Niki Ride trips are individually geared to riders or to groups. Both road and hybrid bikes are available. Cycling coaches are all former or current professional racers with the local professional cycling team, Nasu Blasen. A bike tour targeted at foodies—and as such less focused on endurance and technique—samples local delicacies and area cafes. Package rates for the Niki Ride include accommodations, all meals, spa visits and accident insurance , ,Back at the Niki Club I pulled off my cycling gear and eased into the hotel’s onsen, glad to have stopped moving. The hot springs were another plus about cycling in Japan, especially once the forest’s snow monkeys came to join me, scampering across the deck and leaping from tree to tree. Afterward, I indulged in a massage, plenty of sake at dinner and more bicycle-shaped desserts. (The other big bonus of cycling in Japan is that once you’ve finished riding and your nether parts are predictably sore, you can sit on a heated toilet seat to have the fully automated washlet soothe your bottom with any number of programmable sprays.),The following morning, Ms. Matsuura offered me a choice: an easy “recovery ride,” or a more difficult one to Mount Nasu’s Chausu Peak. Warily, I chose the latter. “Eight and half miles up,” Mr. Wakasugi said, smiling, as we got on our bikes. Maybe he meant kilometers, or even 850 meters? No, I already knew he was too precise for that kind of mistake, even with the language barriers. The ride was punishing, but Mr. Wakasugi kept encouraging me, while suggesting gear changes and different breathing patterns. We made some stops, at a public hot spring where the only thing that kept me from getting in was knowing how difficult it would be to continue after that. Then we passed some cemeteries, which suddenly seemed like good resting places.,The road kept rising, and then some more. But two hours after setting out, we made it to the top, after climbing more than 3,000 feet. Lunch was next, at a local restaurant where the bento boxes included eggs that had been boiled in that same hot spring we’d passed and were somehow delicious.,There was just a short downhill ride after that before we returned to Niki Club, where the eggless onsen beckoned me again. Ms. Matsuura, Mr. Wakasugi and I all hugged and bowed goodbye, a combination that felt exactly right. That night, my wife and I forsook our bed and slept on the tatami in the room instead, and ate a few more firefly squid.,For two days, I’d felt like a local rider. Free from the usual pack of cycling tourists, I got to experience the quiet beauty of rural Nasu at just the right speed, with two people who know every crack on the roads, every nearby hot spring. And I became a better rider too. ,

To order presentation-ready copies for distribution to your colleagues, clients or customers visit http://www.djreprints.com.,http://www.wsj.com/articles/agency-uses-clickbait-for-charities-1471469666,Most people are familiar with frustrating “clickbait” links on the Internet, with titles such as “,” and “,”,But what if the same tactic could be used to raise awareness of charities and to promote donations?, , is an effort by digital marketing agency RXM Creative to do exactly that. The company created a website it says can transform clickbait from “the scourge of the Internet” into something more positive. ,“What we see is clickbait usually points to trivial news and meaningless issues. We wanted to use this [tactic] but shift it onto things that really matter,” said ,Mihai Botarel,, creative director at RXM Creative.,People can visit ClickbaitforGood.org and share clickbait links on their social profiles that drive traffic to charities including World Wildlife Fund, charity: water, Stop Hunger Now and others. ,RXM Creative is also publishing links via a dedicated Clickbait for Good , page and , account, but said it does not plan to pay to promote any of its posts. Instead it will rely on word-of-mouth and social sharing.,The agency is scouring the Web every day for content by or about charities it believes to be advocating for worthy causes, and writing clickbait headlines associated with that content. Charities are free to submit their content for consideration, said Raul Mandru, another creative director RXM Creative. ,“It’s an aggregator of worthy causes. Some of them are well known, but some of them are less known. We want to point to as many causes as possible,” Mr. Mandru said.,“This famous hair stylist has ONE little trick” read a headline posted to the ClickbaitforGood Facebook page on Monday, which links to an article by charity: water about clean-water issues in Mali, West Africa.,“OMG! She is just 16 and she has done things @KimKardashian haven’t even thought about,” the ClickbaitforGood account tweeted Tuesday, linking to a Girls Not Brides post about a woman in Bangladesh who was pressured into an early marriage.,Internet users have become increasingly frustrated with clickbait in recent years, especially on platforms such as Facebook and Twitter. As a result, Facebook , that it plans to “further reduce clickbait” in users’ News Feeds, and said websites and Pages that rely on clickbait-style headlines “should expect their distribution to decrease.”,Mr. Mandru said Facebook’s move is motivated by the same reasons RXM Creative wanted to change the way clickbait is used, but acknowledged that it could see its posts limited by Facebook’s algorithm changes as a result. ,“Facebook is just small part of it. Clickbait is on every site and on every news aggregator. Once this generates awareness we can go to Facebook and show them the project,” Mr. Mandru said.,The website is now live and operational, and RXM Creative began populating the Facebook pages and Twitter accounts with posts on Friday., ,Jack Marshall at , ,

It is curious because under risk-based rules high-risk assets require more capital than low-risk assets, while under the leverage ratio test Mr. Hoenig describes, subprime mortgages carry the same capital requirements as the most well-secured prime mortgages—loans to Argentina or Venezuela look just like loans to Germany.

What Univision Wants With Gawker Media,Shalini Ramachandran,"This copy is for your personal, non-commercial use only. To order presentation-ready copies for distribution to your colleagues, clients or customers visit http://www.djreprints.com.,http://www.wsj.com/articles/what-univision-wants-with-gawker-media-1471460285,When most of us think of Univision Communications, the nation’s largest Spanish broadcaster, soapy “telenovelas” and game shows come to mind. Why would that company want to buy Gawker Media, whose flagship gossip and culture website is known for tweaking the media and celebrities and got into legal hot water for publishing wrestler Hulk Hogan’s sex tape? (Univision , of Gawker on Tuesday.),The answer may come down to one telling stat: Gawker Media’s bouquet of seven blogs skew toward upper-income, millennial male visitors, a very attractive and hard-to-reach demographic. That could be a valuable audience for Univision, given the steps it’s taken over the past year to transform into a digital and millennial-focused company.,Univision’s business consists of the flagship Univision network, other broadcast networks and TV stations, a variety of cable channels and radio stations. Like other TV channel owners, Univision’s core business is contending with a mature U.S. pay-TV business that’s under assault from an array of threats, like cord-cutting and cord-shaving. The Univision broadcast network has suffered steep ratings falloffs (though Univision is quick to point out that some of its smaller networks have grown their audiences).,Now, Univision executives are eyeing an opportunity in digital: to put together a basket of sites that cater to multicultural youth in America, beyond just second-generation Hispanics.,Univision executives have said they’ve found that the edgy, newsy and comedic content that speaks to Hispanic millennials also resonates with multicultural youth in America. In May, Univision CEO ,Randy Falco, noted that half of the nation’s 83 million millennials are non-Caucasian. “We already have a very young audience. We want to take advantage of the fact that we already have an inroad into that young audience, and we want to build on that by the digital strategy that we’re employing,” he said at the time.,To that end, Univision has bought 40.5% of The Onion, the comedy news site, and last year acquired The Root, an African American news destination. In April, the company bought out , , from its prior joint venture Fusion, the news site and cable channel, and it created Fusion Media Group, which now houses sites including The Onion, The Root, Clickhole, and Flama, a digital network catering to second-generation Hispanic audiences. Gawker is likely to end up in that group, which is led by ,Isaac Lee,, Univision’s chief news, entertainment and digital officer.,Univision’s Fusion Media Group and Onion Reach Network reached 65.6 million unique visitors in May, according to comScore stats provided by the company. Mr. Falco has said that his goal is to reach 80 million monthly unique visitors across all Univision platforms, which is the threshold after which he believes the digital business can start operating “very effectively and driving revenue and profitability.” Integrating Gawker could help Univision get to that goal.,Despite its legal woes, Gawker has shown some promise as a business. Its revenue has grown steadily in recent years, although Gawker’s outgoing founder ,Nick Denton, said it was not profitable in 2015 due to legal costs.,In 2015, Gawker generated $48.7 million in revenue, jurors in the Hogan case were told. According to an earlier financial disclosure, the company turned an operating profit of $6.5 million on revenue of $44.3 million in 2014. Mr. Denton has said revenue was up 8% year-on-year in the second quarter of this year. ,Traffic across Gawker’s seven websites was up 3% on the year in July to 56.1 million unique visitors, according to comScore. It skews toward upper-income millennial males, a coveted demographic. More than 40% of its visitors have a household income of more than $100,000, most are between the ages of 18 and 34, and more than 57% are male.,Meanwhile, Gawker has been building a growing ecommerce business.,Typically, companies that are pursuing an IPO don’t like to rock the boat -- so Univision’s decision to acquire a company as controversial as Gawker is an interesting maneuver. Univision was supposed to go public last year but it has delayed the offering amid broader pressure on media stocks due to investor worries about cord-cutting. The company also had $9 billion in debt, net of cash, as of June 30.,It’s possible that Univision won’t stick with the same level of pugilistic posts that Gawker was known for. But Univision executives have noted that they aren’t afraid to embrace that sort of content, given their investment in The Onion. ,—Lukas I.

P&G to Scale Back Targeted Facebook Ads,"Sharon Terlep,Deepa Seetharaman","This copy is for your personal, non-commercial use only. To order presentation-ready copies for distribution to your colleagues, clients or customers visit http://www.djreprints.com.,http://www.wsj.com/articles/p-g-to-scale-back-targeted-facebook-ads-1470760949, , ,, the biggest advertising spender in the world, will move away from ads on Facebook that target specific consumers, concluding that the practice has limited effectiveness., , , has spent years developing its ability to zero in on consumers based on demographics, shopping habits and life milestones. P&G, the maker of myriad household goods including Tide and Pampers, initially jumped at the opportunity to market directly to subsets of shoppers, from teenage shavers to first-time homeowners., ,Marc Pritchard,, P&G’s chief marketing officer, said the company has realized it took the strategy too far.,“We targeted too much, and we went too narrow,” he said in an interview, “and now we’re looking at: What is the best way to get the most reach but also the right precision?”,Mr. Pritchard said P&G won’t cut back on Facebook spending and will employ targeted ads where it makes sense, such as pitching diapers to expectant mothers. He said P&G has ramped up spending both on digital sites and traditional platforms. One category the company is scaling back: smaller websites that lack the reach of sites such as Facebook, Google and YouTube.,On a broader scale, P&G’s shift highlights the limits of such targeting for big brands, one of the cornerstones of Facebook’s ad business. The social network is able to command higher prices for its targeted marketing; the narrower the targeting the more expensive the ad. ,

,P&G could be the bellwether on how consumer goods companies and big brands use digital advertising. Over the past year some marketers, specifically consumer product companies, have discovered they need to go “much more broad” with their advertising on social media sites such as Facebook, said ,James Douglas,, executive director of social-media agency Society, which is owned by , , ,Mr. Douglas said case studies show that companies can receive a bigger sales increase if they reach a more significant portion of a platform’s overall audience. ,For instance, P&G two years ago tried targeting ads for its Febreze air freshener at pet owners and households with large families. The brand found that sales stagnated during the effort, but they rose when the campaign on Facebook and elsewhere was expanded last March to include anyone over 18.,A Facebook spokeswoman said its partnership with P&G “grows every year” and the two companies learn from one another. “That has always been the spirit of how we work together and challenge one another,” she said.,Facebook started working on a targeted ad system in 2007, when it was an unprofitable three-year-old startup with less than 60 million active users. At the time, its , through which companies promoted their products. ,Facebook has since emerged as a marketing platform of singular scale. Last year, Facebook raked in $17.08 billion in ad revenue, up 49% year over year, as advertisers sought the attention of its 1.7 billion monthly active users.,Advertisers can pinpoint their target audience precisely. Political candidates can focus on users in congressional districts, restaurant chains can run campaigns to spicy food lovers, and moving companies can find users who are “very likely” to move to another home.,“If you could run an ad and reach a million people or run a targeted ad to reach 5,000, you have to have pretty impressive returns on that 5,000 to make it worth it,” said ,Peter Daboll,, chief executive of Ace Metrix, which tests ads for effectiveness and works with Facebook.,Cincinnati-based P&G spent roughly $7.2 billion on advertising globally in the year that ended in June, up about 1% from the previous year, according to company filings. P&G said it plans to increase it around 5% for the year that started July 1. Prior to last year’s increase, the company cut spending two years in a row.,P&G’s push to find broader reach with its advertising is also evident in the company’s recent increases in television spending. Toward the end of last year P&G began shifting money back into television, according to people familiar with the matter. During the first quarter of 2016, the company’s ad spending jumped 11% to $429 million from the year earlier, Kantar Media said.,For many of the largest advertisers in the world, the precise targeting tools touted by Facebook are less of a draw, said Pivotal Research analyst ,Brian Weiser.,“The bigger your brand, the more you need broad reach and less targeted media,” he said. Targeting is paramount for advertisers trying to get users to download a game app or a small business trying to appeal to local customers.,Facebook has started offering new tools specifically for large advertisers, including , by showing ads to people who are more likely to pay attention to them. On Tuesday, it introduced changes that , from appearing on its desktop website. ,“The cornerstone of our ad strategy is a mix of mass reach and personalized targeting that lends well to mobile consumption and is a strong complement to TV,” the Facebook spokeswoman said.,Not all big advertisers are pulling back on Facebook’s targeted marketing., , , said it expects lower returns in the current quarter from bookings generated from its advertising, much of which goes through , ,’s Google. As a result the travel company plans to increase spending on Facebook’s targeted ads.,“We found that a number of things we’ve done on Facebook works well,” Chief Executive ,Jeffery Boyd, said. “We would like to spend more money on Facebook going forward.”, , , The correct name of the CEO of Priceline Group Inc. is ,Jeffery Boyd., An earlier version of this article misstated his name.

So I was like, ‘I’ll do dogs.’”,Three years later, Mr. Friedman’s Instagram account , has 2.1 million followers. He has an assistant and a manager and counts brands like Purina as sponsors. He wrote a book and has another on the way (about puppies).,Social media influencers have existed for years, but more recently there has been a , (or “celebridogs,” as Mr. Friedman puts it). Mr. Friedman’s account has more longevity, he says, because he takes pictures of new dogs each day. He says he has taken photos of 10,000 to 15,000 dogs in three years, and “knows more dogs by name than people.”,Like other digital players big and small, The Dogist has to contend with a shifting media environment. Mr. Friedman says he is devoting more resources toward video, which is more out of his comfort zone as a photographer, not to mention expensive.,Still, he says that his behind-the-scenes videos on Snapchat generate about 17,000 views apiece, making the platform his second-most engaged, behind Instagram, where photos receive about 60,000 likes. Mr. Friedman says that ,, a feature almost identical to Snapchat, is “a little scary for Snapchat right now.”,“They basically made a carbon copy of it and said, ‘We can do it too, and what are you going to do about it?’” he said.,As for the future, Mr. Friedman says he will continue to expand The Dogist’s video operation and is in talks with TV networks about potential shows. Mr. Friedman also operates ,, though he finds it difficult to make cats sit still for photos.,For more with Mr. Friedman, check out the episode and subscribe on ,, ,, , or Stitcher., ,Steven Perlberg at , ,

Exotes are a rare breed, and my guess is that few read this newspaper. “But what the devil is an exote?” you ask. “Some kind of gender-bender or cutting-edge hipster?” Actually, the term, coined in 1904 by the French writer Victor Segalen, denotes a passionate, self-immersing traveler to exotic realms, as against a mere “impressionistic tourist.” In “The Glamour of Strangeness,” a splendid book marred only by its awkward title, Jamie James borrows and adapts Segalen’s term, applying it to a number of 19th- and 20th-century writers and artists who, in his view, exemplify the type.

Viacom and Sumner Redstone’s National Amusements , and COO ,Tom Dooley, will become interim CEO, with a good chance to score the permanent gig, The Wall Street Journal reports. The deal is expected to be announced Friday. NAI will appoint five directors, including ,Thomas May,, who will become chairman after Mr. Dauman relinquishes that title on Sept. 13. The bottom line: a settlement will mark the completion of the ascent of Shari Redstone, Mr. Redstone’s daughter, who is poised to take pole position in the family empire.

It’s certainly the end of an era, brought about by extraordinary circumstances (particularly the unlikely financial and legal union of Hulk Hogan and ,Peter Thiel,). For his part, Hulk Hogan, whose lawsuit drove Gawker Media into bankruptcy, ,, “They messed with the wrong guy brother.” In a memo to staff, Gawker Media founder ,Nick Denton, said Gawker.com may “have a second act” one day, but he “will move on to other projects, working to make the web a forum for the open exchange of ideas and information, but out of the news and gossip business.”, ,: Speaking of things shutting down, the ,, the mobile news app it launched two years ago with the hopes of luring in young subscribers, CMO Today reports.

Indeed, the Times said it would now focus on “targeting younger readers where they often are: on social platforms.” Plus, the Times said that some of the things it figured out through NYT Now, like how to curate Times articles and make them look appealing on mobile devices, will live on through its main New York Times app., ,: The subject of , media empire.

(Mr. Murdoch is serving as acting chief executive.) HarperCollins still wants that memoir, which would have major commercial appeal, though how much Mr. Ailes could dish about his former employer is unclear (if his $40 million exit package included a nondisclosure agreement that would be a barrier).

On Thursday, the head of Rio’s state investigative police said Mr. Lochte, along with fellow gold medalists James Feigen, Gunnar Bentz and Jack Conger, ,and were kept there by armed security guards until they paid for the damage. He rejected Mr. Lochte’s account and said the incident remains under investigation.,The controversy has made international headlines and raises questions about the ramifications the incident will have on Mr. Lochte’s ability to cash in on his storied career that now includes 12 Olympic medals.,If it’s true that Mr. Lochte lied, “it will virtually eliminate him from future endorsements,” said ,Bob Williams,, chief executive of Burns Entertainment & Sports Marketing, a firm that represents advertisers who hire celebrities for endorsement deals. “Advertisers have become far less tolerant of controversial behavior of any type, and this is yet another type of controversial behavior that doesn’t reflect well on a brand.”,Mr. Lochte has had plenty of success over the years with corporate America including an endorsement pact with , ,’s Gillette brand during the London Olympics.

He isn’t going to change and we’re going to lose big time if we continue down this road. We don’t have until Labor Day to...

Univision said it will integrate the sites Deadspin, Lifehacker, Gizmodo, Jalopnik, Jezebel and Kotaku into its Fusion Media Group. But the company said it wouldn’t operate Gawker.com going forward. ,The site had been at the center of series of damaging lawsuits over posts it had published. One of those stories, which featured a sex tape involving former professional wrestler Hulk Hogan, ultimately forced the company into bankruptcy. ,U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Stuart M. Bernstein signed off on the Univision deal Thursday, saying it was the best outcome to save the company from the financial morass it had found itself in stemming from the crushing weight of the lawsuits. ,Gawker “never really had a chance” of reorganizing on its own, he said. The sale is expected to close Sept. 9.,Hulk Hogan, whose real name is Terry Bollea, filed an invasion-of-privacy suit against the company and won a $140 million jury verdict. Gawker Media filed for chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in June after a Florida judge upheld the verdict. Gawker has appealed.,Shortly before Gawker filed for bankruptcy, it emerged that many of its legal struggles had been secretly backed by Silicon Valley billionaire and investor ,Peter Thiel,, who acknowledged financing the cases brought by Mr. Bollea and others. Mr. Thiel had been outed as gay in 2007 by Gawker’s now-defunct Valleywag blog and said his intention was to stop Gawker from profiting off exposing details of people’s private lives.,In a memo to staff, Mr. Denton lamented the demise of the site he created in 2003, but said “it will live on in legend.” ,“Sadly, neither I nor Gawker.com, the buccaneering flagship of the group I built with my colleagues, are coming along for this next stage,” he said. “Desirable though the other properties are, we have not been able to find a single media company or investor willing also to take on Gawker.com. The campaign being mounted against its editorial ethos and former writers has made it too risky. I can understand the caution.”,Mr. Denton said that the site will cease publishing new stories Monday but that the archives will be preserved.,Gawker.com said in a post that its staffers will be assigned to other editorial roles at one of the six other sites or at Univision. Gawker Media staffers unionized last year, and the union says that Univision has agreed to recognize the existing contract.,Univision’s acquisition of Gawker comes as the Spanish-language broadcaster has moved to become a more digital company with a greater focus on a millennial audience.,In its statement, Univision said the acquisition of Gawker’s properties would ,and give it access to a much broader audience.,In January, the company acquired a roughly 40% stake in humor site The Onion, branching out into comedy content that isn’t targeted at a Hispanic audience. In April, Univision bought out , ,’s stake in their Fusion joint venture, a news site and cable channel focused on catering to younger audiences and second-generation Hispanics.

The officials didn’t promise that they were telling the whole truth this time, but the leverage explanation sounds plausible. One presumes, though, that without the leverage of cash withheld, Iran might have chosen to keep the hostages locked up. If that wasn’t the case, there was no need for...

Terms of the swimmer’s endorsement deal weren’t disclosed. ,“I respect Speedo’s decision and am grateful for the opportunities that our partnership has afforded me over the years. I am proud of the accomplishments that we have achieved together,” Mr. Lochte said in a statement. ,Last week, as Mr. Lochte’s tale of an alleged robbery unraveled, Speedo said it was “following the situation,” echoing similar statements from mattress maker Airweave and Ralph Lauren at the time.,Mr. Lochte originally grabbed headlines when he said he and three fellow U.S. swimmers were robbed by men posing as police, and that one had pointed a gun to his head. But by Saturday, after the Rio police said Mr. Lochte fabricated the account and footage from a gas station emerged, Mr. Lochte went on an apology tour. , ,, he said that he “over-exaggerated” and was “immature” and that he had been intoxicated during the event. He stopped short at admitting to lying about the details of the situation. Brazilian police said the swimmers stopped at a gas station on the way back from a party and damaged property and urinated on a wall of the station.,By late last week, the incident had ,. A Ralph Lauren spokesman on Monday said the company’s agreement with Mr. Lochte was specifically for the Rio Olympics, and that it “will not be renewing his contract.” ,Airweave USA put out a statement on Twitter saying, “Our endorsement agreement with Ryan Lochte was in support of the Rio 2016 Olympic Games. ” Adding, “After careful consideration, we have made the decision to end our partnership with Ryan Lochte.”,Another sponsor, Gentle Hair Removal, also ended its partnership with Mr. Lochte. “We hold our employees to high standards, and we expect the same of our business partners,” Syneron-Candela, the brand’s parent company, said in a statement. The swimmer had previous sponsorship deals with companies such as , , and Gatorade, but those agreements have expired. , ,Bob Williams,, chief executive of Burns Entertainment & Sports Marketing, a firm that represents advertisers who hire celebrities for endorsement deals, said last week that the incident could do serious harm to Mr. Lochte’s endorsement potential. “Advertisers have become far less tolerant of controversial behavior of any type,” he said.,—Suzanne Kapner contributed to this article., ,Steven Perlberg at , ,

The New Miniskirt Suit: Fashion’s Tribute to Ally McBeal?,,"This copy is for your personal, non-commercial use only. To order presentation-ready copies for distribution to your colleagues, clients or customers visit http://www.djreprints.com.,http://www.wsj.com/articles/the-new-miniskirt-suit-fashions-tribute-to-ally-mcbeal-1471893715, , spot it? The hip-jiggling baby that shook its diaper-clad booty around the abbreviated skirt suits on the fall runways of Michael Kors, Tory Burch and Courrèges? I may have been in the grip of a delusion, but those suits, featuring the briefest of mini skirts, conjured feel-good memories of the late-1990s TV show, “Ally McBeal.” (For the uninitiated: The protagonist, a 30-ish lawyer, regularly hallucinated a dancing baby, a symbol of her ticking biological clock, in her weekly search for a soul mate).,Played by ,Calista Flockhart,, Ally wore a rotation of suits from brands such as Emporio Armani and DKNY, rendered in somber shades with the occasional hit of girlish lavender—a largely restrained wardrobe worthy of a professional starting out back in the day. Except for those ever-rising hems, of course.,The program, which aired from 1997 to 2002, debuted just before another postfeminist TV show, “Sex and the City”; both were predicated on the notion that working women had not only love but clothing on their minds. Ally’s fictional Boston law firm, Cage, Fish & Associates, subscribed only passingly to sexual- harassment policies, and finding a partner meant wading through complex, love-hate relationships with colleagues.,Out in the wider, harsher world, ,Bill Clinton, was being impeached, George W. Bush had a contentious win against ,Al Gore, in the 2000 election and the dot-com bubble burst. As Ally put it, “Whenever I get depressed, I raise my hemlines.”,In 2016, with our fears stoked by terrorism, the aftermath of Brexit and America’s can’t-make-this-stuff-up presidential election, we could all do with a bit of cheering up. At least a few fashion designers, it seems, have adopted Ally’s remedy: the aforementioned, leg-baring, expressively shrunken skirt suit. But, speaking of fear, can you wear one if you don’t have Ms. Flockhart’s petite, coltish frame?,“I don’t know that it’s about those who can and those who can’t,” said designer Tory Burch. Rather, she said, it’s about having the confidence to pull it off. Her iteration for fall has a fitted boxy jacket, matching turtleneck and double-pleated skirt—all with a retro chain-motif. (It was inspired by the cult 1972 film “L’Amour l’après-midi,” not the American dramedy.) Ms. Burch advised finishing the look with flats as she showed it on her runway. You might also try low block-heel pumps, but nothing higher than a couple inches.,While Ally pursued her colleagues, and the occasional verdict, in solid-colored suits, some of today’s renditions embrace pattern. The Courrèges jacket and skirt pictured here have a graphic windowpane motif. In his version, Michael Kors went for classic navy but spiked it with sweater and shirt cuffs that finish dramatically, if inefficiently, around the fingertips. The revived shape offers a way to wear a skirt suit without feeling staid. Added Ms. Burch, “They have a sense of elegance and effortlessness.” Which may or may not help you come Nov. 8.,

The intricate figures and approach to landscape on a diminutive scale in “Divine Pleasures: Painting from India’s Rajput Courts”—a collection of centuries-old, sacred-text illustrations on view until Sept. 12—were so seductive, I forgot the foul heat and jackhammering of the city. I also found the inspiration for this month’s arrangement, in “Radha With Her Confidante, Pining for Krishna” (ca. 1775-1780).,The watercolor and ink painting on paper, only about 7 by 11 inches, depicts a fraught, beyond-Brangelina moment in the love affair between Radha, a goddess of devotion and loyalty, and the god Krishna. He has abandoned her, though he will later recognize his foolishness.,A matte black vessel by ceramist ,Christine Roland, gave my arrangement texture and tone reminiscent of the tree trunks. Full yellow roses, deep orange kangaroo paws, branches of kumquats and flowering crab apple, and eucalyptus pods and leaves provided exoticism.,The branches that slant upward to the left mimic the line the eye travels from the leaning pose of desperate Radha to the trees and hills. A single violet clematis bloom droops over the edge of the vase, echoing the confidant’s skirt in shape and color. The arrangement is dense within an intimate scale, like the painting. No need to be oversize to exude an otherworldly passion.,

The Trump Shake-Up,,"This copy is for your personal, non-commercial use only. To order presentation-ready copies for distribution to your colleagues, clients or customers visit http://www.djreprints.com.,http://www.wsj.com/articles/the-trump-shake-up-1471898418, ,Welcome to “The Journal Editorial Report.” I’m Paul Gigot.,Another big shake-up in the Trump campaign this week, with the Republican presidential nominee promoting veteran GOP pollster Kellyanne Conway to campaign manager and appointing Stephen Bannon, chairman of the conservative media outlet Breitbart News, to campaign CEO. In Cleveland Wednesday, Democratic rival Hillary Clinton said the changes really don’t change a thing., , , , Joining the panel this week, Wall Street Journal columnist and deputy editor Dan Henninger, columnists Jason Riley and Kim Strassel, and associate editorial page editor James Freeman.,So, Kim, let’s take these personnel changes first. Do these first—do these choices—can they make a difference in the campaign?, ,Well, look, they seem to have made some difference so far. What we have seen this week is a Donald Trump who has been reading from script in a more disciplined manner. We saw a Donald Trump in Charlotte, N.C., who actually expressed regret for some of the comments that he’d made and started talking about how this needed to be a campaign that pulled people together.,We know that he’s going to be giving a series of policy speeches over the next couple of weeks that touch on immigration and education reform. So this is a different Donald Trump, you know. And you see the influence of Kellyanne Conway and Steve Bannon. The question is can he stay on track?, , Right, but I want to distinguish here between Bannon and Conway. Because Kellyanne Conway, I think—I think we saw her hand in some of that language in the Charlotte speech. What skills, experience, does she bring to the Trump campaign?, , Look, she is more of a veteran person in politics. She has worked on a lot of campaigns, interestingly, with kind of antiestablishment characters in the past, so she’s comfortable in that realm. She’s very knowledgeable about the women’s vote. She’s made a kind of study and an art of it. And her goal is to try to, I think, maybe make Donald Trump not just more rigorous and disciplined but humanize his campaign a little bit and make him more optimistic. She’s said as much., , That’s not Steve Bannon’s forte. Dan?, , Well, Steve Bannon’s forte is to appeal to unionized Democrats, blue-collar workers—the “forgotten people,” as Trump describes them. And I think what we’re seeing here is that Trump has finally figured out that he’s not going to win merely with the base that provided him the victory in the primaries. That’s 35% or 40% of the vote. The opinion polls show that you lose if that’s all you get in the general election. So now I read that speech where he talks about the system being rigged—that’s Bernie Sanders—when he attacked Washington insiders—that’s Ted Cruz., , But those are old messages. It’s the regret and the inclusiveness of the Charlotte speech—, , I’m talking about the base he’s trying to assemble. And I agree that, then, Kellyanne Conway adds something with the Republican women. So clearly Trump has figured out that he needs to go beyond the primary base., , What about the Bannon appointment?, ,Right. This is—this is desperation on the part of Donald Trump, shaking up his campaign this close to Labor Day, which is really the beginning of the home stretch. You know, things are—he’s in trouble and he knows it. I think this is something of a Hail Mary. Bannon, to me, signals that Trump wants to be Trump., , And that’s what Trump says., , Bannon runs Breitbart, a website that, if anything, thinks Trump has been too mild-mannered and measured up until now, if you watch their coverage of the campaign. So this is someone, I think, who wants Trump to continue running the campaign he ran in the primaries, and that’s what he’s surrounded himself with.,I think Kellyanne Conway—we all know her. We’ve known her a long time, very respected pollster. But she’s not a campaign manager. She’s—this is going to be new for her. She’s going to have to adjust to this., , I don’t think she’s going to—, , —and we’ll see if Trump—, , I think that’s her title, Jason. I don’t think she’s going to manage the campaign. I think she’s going to try to improve and refine the message., , Right, but campaigns are about the candidate, and then there’s only so much advice Trump seems willing to take., , There’s no question about that. And he’d have to—but here’s what I—what’s surprising to me. Trump said when he made the appointments, “I’m not going to pivot. I don’t want to pivot. I’m not changing. I’m the same person.” And then he gives that speech, which is a different person., , Yeah—, , At least, it’s different rhetoric. And if he stays with—in my view, if he had given that speech at the convention and then that had been the speech for the last three weeks, I think this campaign could be in a different place., ,Yeah. It was a very effective speech. It was a speech to all the people, to the forgotten people who aren’t Washington insiders, but to all Americans. And I think there was something in there for all Americans to appreciate, and that’s why I think this has been a good few days. I think Trump has benefited from creating a structure now. You don’t want too much management in top campaigns. You don’t want them to be bureaucratic. But he needed a staff beyond his own instincts going out on Twitter.,So I think, if you’d think of Kellyanne Conway as competently allowing him to speak to a broader audience, maybe Bannon’s role is to more precisely target the case against Hillary Clinton. This could be a big win., , All right. He’s also rolling out his first ads in the campaign. Let’s listen to the first one., , , , , , Kim, first of all, just running ads is a step forward for the Trump campaign—, , It is., , —because he hasn’t run any so far in the general election.,But what do you make of that message? That’s not the message of Charlotte. That’s the Trump of antiterror and the primaries., , Yeah. It’s the Trump, too, that is trying to play off grievances out there, a general sense of malaise among voters that they’re not moving forward, that there’s a sense of disorder out there in the world. I mean, there’s an element of optimism to the ad, too, in that it is presenting at least a future in which they’re saying that the world will be better under Trump., , Right., , It’s not very specific on how that would happen. But this is sort of more the Donald Trump of the primary., , Anybody else have a take on this? James?, , Well, look, this is a winning issue for him, as far as limiting immigration from parts of the world with a history of terrorism. He said in North Carolina—that dovetails with that ad—“We’re not going to let in people who think Shariah law supplants the U.S. Constitution.” I don’t know anyone who could disagree with that statement. And you look at polls, this is a winning message. Let’s—I’m for immigration. Let’s have immigration but keep out jihadists., , All right. Thank you all. When we come back, Donald Trump’s antiterror strategy. He’s taking on the Obama-Clinton record and laying out his own plan to fight radical Islam. So just how different is his approach?, , , , , , That was Donald Trump this week, taking on the Obama-Clinton foreign-policy legacy in a speech in Youngstown, Ohio, and laying out his own strategy to fight radical Islam.,So, Dan, let me start just by going back to what James said at the end of that last block, where he said this is a winner for Trump, on restricting immigration from countries with a history of terrorism. You agree with that?, , Well, as you suggested, Paul, there are two Trumps, at the moment, running. There’s the one we saw in that ad and there was the one in the North Carolina speech. In that North Carolina speech, he said he will create a system of immigration that allows immigration to work, perhaps appealing to those Republicans who think we need a system of immigration that allows people to come in and go back out. But I don’t think attacking immigrants like that is going to win him votes in, say, Pennsylvania or Virginia or Wisconsin, the battleground states., , Jason?, , I think where it can be a winning issue, Dan, is in how he describes the threat. And this is the politically incorrect Trump that a lot of those voters like. He at least is going to call it what it is. He is not going to pretend—like the Obama administration has, like Hillary Clinton has—that there’s no religious element to this; these are just “radicals.” He’s going to talk about—he’s going to call the threat what it is, radical Islam.,And I think he can—I think that is a winning issue for him. And there was a lot of good stuff in that speech. Paul, he talked about prematurely leaving Iraq, creating this vacuum that ISIS has filled. But, at the same time, a lot of Trump’s foreign policy is similar to Obama’s, and the isolationist strain that we see there., , That’s what I want to talk about. I thought the critique of the Obama-Clinton record was a lot stronger than his program and a lot clearer than what he laid out would be the differences. Because in terms of taking on ISIS, he said he’ll do it faster and he’ll do it viciously if he has to, but he didn’t have any details about how he would do it overseas in Syria, Iraq or Libya or anything else. That’s all vague., , That is vague. But he has said a couple things which I think resonate. One is he’s saying now that he wants to work with allies. People, kind of, wondered about that, whether it was going to be a one-man band.,But he’s also saying—it’s a very focused strategy. He’s saying “I want to kill ISIS; I want to get rid of people who are trying to kill us. I don’t want to do nation-building.” I think people who have watched, over the last decade, a couple of presidents not entirely competently dealing especially with the Middle East region. I think that’s going to resonate with people., , He also talks about courting moderate Muslims, which I think is something we need to do., , But you guys have low bars for foreign-policy threshold., , Well, look at the competition., , Kim, how—what do you think the big differences are between Trump’s antiterror strategy and Hillary Clinton’s?, , Well, look, I mean, Hillary Clinton has basically said that she will continue Barack Obama’s foreign-policy strategy. And Donald Trump did, very, very well, critique that in that speech.,I think one of the things that would matter is, he is going to talk, as Jason said, more openly about what the threat is. And he is going to try to maybe prosecute this in a lot more aggressive way.,But the specifics, Paul—this is a problem—is what’s missing. You know, I disagree a little bit with James on the idea that there is a distinction here between Trump and Obama on some of these questions. You know, he’s been very reticent, for instance, to say what he would do in Syria. You know, and there are things that you can do that are short of boots on the ground, things like safe zones. But we don’t necessarily have that commitment from him.,So it’s just—this is one of the lacking aspects of his foreign policy, is we don’t know what he’d do., , I want to get in the—Dan, the news this week that the Clinton Foundation—and this relates to foreign policy because they have accepted foreign donations in the past. Now they’re saying, the foundation is saying, that if Hillary Clinton wins, they won’t accept any foreign donations.,Now, they already—they promised eight years ago that they wouldn’t accept any foreign donations when Hillary was secretary of state. Why should we believe them now?, , Well, there’s no reason why we should believe them. I mean, I think the person who really made it interesting was former Pennsylvania governor Ed Rendell—Democrat, prominent Democrat—who suggested if she wins, they should close the foundation. You know what I think these Democrats are afraid of? They’re afraid that, if they keep the foundation open, something will be in there that will allow Hillary Clinton to be impeached., , Well, and this will be—they’ll use it as the—as a fundraiser for Chelsea Clinton’s Senate campaign., , It’s a big political liability for them., , This is marketing. It’s like when a car dealer says “you’ve got to get in here by Labor Day or these deals are going away.” That’s what they’re saying. By Election Day, you’ve got to send your checks in. But we know the foundation will continue, just as the dealership will continue after those deals roll off the lot., , Even more to the point, what conflicts of interest will suddenly arise when she’s president that weren’t there when she was secretary of state, that she’s diplomat of the country—, , Right., , —in dealing with foreign donations?, , Well, but that’s why you get to the point—Ed Rendell’s point. Let’s—shouldn’t they shut it down?, , Of course. Of course., , Yeah, Kim, go ahead., , Well, no, also because we know that saying that you’re not going to accept donations from corporations or foreign governments doesn’t mean anything. Look, stories of the past year have shown that these donations from wealthy individuals seeking influence have been routed through family foundations and other charities which, by the way, the Clinton Foundation said that they’ll continue to take., , All right. When we come back, tensions are rising following Russia’s use this week of an Iranian air base for strikes in Syria and amid new reports of troop buildup on the Ukraine border. So just what is Vladimir Putin up to and will the United States respond?, , Russia’s involvement in the five-year-old Syrian civil war took a troubling turn this week, when Moscow announced that it is using an air base in western Iran to launch strikes against Syrian militants. The move comes amid reports that Russia is building up its military presence on its western border, sending tens of thousands of troops to newly built installations within striking distance of Ukraine.,David Satter is a former Moscow correspondent and a senior fellow at the Hudson Institute. He’s author of the new book “The Less You Know, the Better You Sleep: Russia’s Road to Terror and Dictatorship Under Yeltsin and Putin.”,So, David, welcome to the program., ,Thanks., , Let’s start with the news about the troop buildup on Ukraine—the border with Ukraine. Russia says this is in response to NATO’s buildup, but NATO’s buildup is minor and it’s not inside Ukraine. What’s going on here from Putin’s point of view?, , I think that Putin is trying to intimidate the West. Obviously they can’t be responding to a NATO buildup which is not taking place in Ukraine. But he’s definitely trying to show that Western sanctions will only make him more aggressive, and therefore the Western countries should see reason, remove the sanctions, and under those circumstances, it’s possible that his appetite for Ukrainian territory will be tempered.,Of course, there are alternative strategies, including arming the Ukrainians and increasing their ability to defend themselves. But that’s not what Putin is hoping the West will choose., , Well, and of course President Obama has refused to send—to sell lethal weapons to Ukraine.,But eight years ago, at the last year of the Bush administration, Putin invaded Georgia in central Asia, and they still have part of that territory. Now, this is eight years later, the last year of the Obama administration, presidential transition coming up. Do you think an invasion inside Ukraine again is possible?, , It’s certainly possible, but it’s absolutely not guaranteed. We just don’t know whether what’s taking place now is an attempt to intimidate the Ukrainians and the West and, of course, to further destabilize the situation inside Ukraine, or whether it’s a serious preparation for invasion.,If it is, of course, the West will have to think very carefully about what kind of measures can be undertaken to prevent even further aggression and loss of life in Ukraine., , So how much of this is about domestic Russian politics? That is, the last couple of years, with Western sanctions and with the fall of the price of oil, the Russian economy has suffered. Now Putin’s poll ratings are still high. But could this all be—and I point to the Syrian flights as well, via Iran—is this an attempt to stir up domestic nationalism on Putin’s part?, , Oh, definitely. In fact, it’s important to bear in mind, in the case of Russia, that war is an instrument of foreign—of domestic policy, I’m sorry. The Russian leadership—and it’s not only Putin; this is also Yeltsin—started wars in order to boost the support of the population for the regime, whichever regime it happened to be, and to distract the population from the way in which they were being misruled., , The—it’s interesting. The last two American presidents, Bush and Obama, both went into office saying we’d like to work with Putin. At the end of their administrations, they’re both saying something very different. Now Donald Trump is saying, if I become president, wouldn’t it be great if we could have a good relationship with Russia? Do you think that makes sense on Trump’s part? Or is he—would he have a very rough education if he did win?, , He will have the same education that every other American president has had, except for Ronald Reagan, who had an instinctive understanding of the Russian political culture and the Soviet Union. And the fact is that we are guilty in the U.S. of ignoring the atrocities that have been committed in Russia and closing our eyes. I mean, when the “reset” policy was initiated by President Obama, it came in the wake of evidence that the Russian government, for example, had been involved in the poisoning, the nuclear poisoning of Alexander Litvinenko in London and the murder of Anna Politkovskaya in Moscow. And it—to start a reset with a regime guilty of such crimes is totally unrealistic. And of course we—, , Do you think—, , Go ahead., , No—, , Well, and of course we’ve ignored the most important crime, which was the 1999 apartment bombings which brought Putin to power., , Do you think Putin wants Donald Trump to win, and would he meddle in the American election campaign?, , He might well meddle in the American election campaign, but I think people in the United States overestimate the extent to which the Putin regime is counting on one or another of the candidates to win.,Trump has said many uninformed and inappropriate things, but it’s also true that when Hillary Clinton was secretary of state, she, with full access to intelligence information that she apparently either ignored or didn’t understand, initiated a policy of reset that was based on an image of Russia that has no relationship to reality. So I don’t think that the Russians think there’s going to be some gigantic difference if it’s Trump or Clinton. They understand that there’s superficiality on both sides., , All right. Thank you, David Satter—very interesting. Thanks for coming in.,Still ahead, Donald Trump makes his pitch to black voters, taking on Democrats and the failed liberal policies of the past., , , , , , Donald Trump in West Bend, Wis., this week, making his most direct pitch yet to black voters and connecting the recent violence in nearby Milwaukee to the plight of African-Americans in cities nationwide and to decades of failed Democratic policies.,We’re back with Dan Henninger, Kim Strassel, James Freeman and Jason Riley, author of the book “Please Stop Helping Us: How Liberals Make It Harder for Blacks to Succeed.”,So, Jason, I want to get the voting side of this. But let’s talk about the law-and-order message that Trump has been delivering. That has probably been arguably his most consistent message certainly since the convention. Is it working?, , I think it’s working to some extent. It’s playing to his strengths. There is a lot of unrest around the country. There’s a lot of tension between cops and these minority communities. You have the Black Lives Matter movement out there throwing gasoline on the fire, frankly. So, yes, I think that that message can resonate, yes., , And, Dan, you wrote this week that you thought this was actually a place where Trump can drive a real sharp distinction with Democrats who have been—who are ambivalent, I think was the word you used, about anticrime policies., , Yes. Well, I said that he was running a law-and-order campaign both at home and aboard. His antiterror policies are essentially a law-and-order version of it. And I think the Democrats have always been ambivalent. And it is their Achilles’ heel. Richard Nixon ran on law and order against Hubert Humphrey in 1968. In the 2004 election then-President George W. Bush raised the issue of whether John Kerry could lead the war on terror. It’s always a good issue for Republicans, because the Democrats always argue that in the inner cities like Milwaukee or Baltimore, the police are at fault as the people committing the crimes. Most Americans, I don’t think, believe that, and Trump is raising that issue., , But here’s the problem, James. The crime figures are way down. This is not 1968. It is—you know, I mean, there have been murder increases in the last couple years in a lot of cities, no question. But as far as some general broad increase in crime, we haven’t really seen it., , No, but remember, a lot of those gains, especially in a city like New York, for example, occurred because of policing tactics that are largely condemned by Democrats like Hillary Clinton.,Also, what has given him the political opening obviously is this sort of war on police since Ferguson. And you have seen lately, although they’re still relatively low, historically murder rates coming up in the nation’s largest cities. And I think he made a disciplined case here to say this most of all hurts the black community. And the problem is not too many police it’s too few. People need safety in urban neighborhoods., , What about this reaching out, Kim, to the African-American vote? We have been arguing for years that Republicans should do this. He’s now trying to do that. But the polls suggest so far he really isn’t doing very well among black voters. What do you make of the pitch?, , Well, the upside is he has got nowhere to go but up because at the moment by some estimates he’s getting about 1% of the black vote. And I think he has also got a very strong message here in that what he’s—you know, Hillary Clinton is feeding this narrative that this is talking about these occasional shootings. Donald Trump instead wanted to talk about the root causes of poverty and crime in inner cities. He talked about the failings of domestic policies that Democrats promote on education and other issues, manufacturing policy. So he’s trying to actually get to the root causes.,I think the bigger question though is: Can you do it by just giving a one-off speech? You have to do this in a sustained manner. You’ve also got to do what you have seen Paul Ryan doing, which is making alliances within faith-based communities, within minority communities, within cities, going and visiting and showing that you’re not just asking for a vote but that you understand the problems and that you’re devoted to having a cooperative relationship going forward., , No offense to West Bend, Wis., but it’s not a center city—it’s not an African-American audience who are going to make this kind of pitch, why not go right there?, , Right. Exactly. You’re asking for the white vote—or for the black vote but you’re doing it in a white suburb in front of a white audience. Kim is absolutely right. Trump has to go into these neighborhoods, he has to introduce himself to these folks, and ask them to explain their concerns to him, and tell people why his policies would be different from the liberal policies that they have been living under.,You know, Trump—effective black outreach is not just about standing in front of an audience and saying he supports school choice or talking about how Democrats take the black vote for granted. Is Trump advertising on black radio stations? Is he spending money on television shows that black people watch?, , Jason, he hasn’t been advertising anywhere., , But, you know, he has got to roll up his sleeves and go into these communities. And I don’t think he’s done that, Paul, because I really don’t think the black vote is part of his winning strategy. I don’t think that’s what he’s trying to do. He’s trying to go after a different demographic group and, frankly, I don’t think he thinks he needs the black vote in November., , Well, I’m not sure it’s a black-white issue on this because he basically managed somehow to win the Republican nomination without doing any of the retail politicking we normally associate. He wasn’t walking through diners in Portsmouth, N.H., and Ames, Iowa., , Yes, but this is the general election. These rallies aren’t going to be good enough, James. And he’s preaching to the converted in the rallies. Why don’t you go to Louisiana, go to a charter school this week, and then maybe go to a Harlem charter school the next week? And then after that talk to a whole town hall., , That kind of sustained coordination., , Right, exactly, or downtown Baltimore. What’s wrong with that?, , Yes, you hope his new campaign team gives him that. What you’re starting to see now, though, is a focused message, that’s what we’re seeing in these recent speeches., , Dan?, , Well, I think I agree with all this, but I think he was also trying to appeal to suburban Republican voters in a way that suggests to them that Donald Trump understands the problems exist in black America and that he has an alternative answer to it. So it wasn’t just that he has to go into those neighborhoods, he has to appeal to suburban Republican voters if he’s going to win., , All right. Still ahead, with Donald Trump facing an uphill battle in some battleground states, Republican fears of a Senate loss grow. But could ticket-splitting voters save some vulnerable Republican incumbents?, , With Donald Trump losing ground in some recent swing-state polls, Republican leaders are keeping an anxious eye on the Senate, where Republicans are defending 24 seats in November, compared to just 10 for Democrats.,Republican pollster Whit Ayres is here to tell us how some key races are shaping up.,So, Whit, welcome back. Good to see you., ,Thanks. Paul, good to be with you., , So I’m hearing more and more anxiety among Republicans across the country that if the race is really a 10-point defeat for Donald Trump—and we’re not there yet obviously, but if it is, that will take down the Senate, too, and maybe even the House. How do you see it?, , Paul, any time you’re defending 24 seats, it’s a challenging effort in the best of environments., , Right., , This is obviously not the best of environments with Donald Trump at the top of the ticket. But I’m a lot more optimistic than a number of Republicans about the possibility of holding the Senate. You have a lot of Republicans who have their own independent identities. And the Trump brand is very distinct from the Republican brand. ,We could see a level of split-ticket voting in this election—greater than anything we have seen since the 1980s when a lot of Southern conservatives voted for Ronald Reagan at the top of the ticket, the Democrat down the ballot. So there a lot of Republican incumbents running well ahead of Donald Trump in their home states., , Well, let me take that ticket-splitting point, because as you know, the recent history has been that there’s less and less ticket-splitting. More and more people just voting down ballots. So why do you think this year is going to be different from that relatively recent trend, particularly when you see a lot of Democrats basically getting in behind Hillary Clinton and not the same kind of unity behind Trump?, , Because in recent years, Paul, the people at the top of the ticket have reflected the values of the people down the ticket. That’s not the case this year. You had a Trump convention which bore no resemblance to a Republican convention when the two most recent Republican presidents—the two most recent Republican nominees. The Republican host governor and most of the other Republican candidates didn’t even show up. ,That created a Trump brand distinct from the Republican brand. Just look at the some of the polling today. Marco Rubio in Florida. Rob Portman in Ohio. Chuck Grassley in Iowa. A number of others running are double digits ahead of Donald Trump. And there’s no reason to think they can’t continue to do that., , Well, OK, but in some states you’re seeing Republican Senate candidates run ahead of Donald Trump but five points, six points, I’m thinking of Pat Toomey in Pennsylvania; I’m thinking of Kelly Ayotte in New Hampshire. They can probably do that—they can afford a five-, six-point Trump undertow in a state. But 10, 12—that becomes very difficult to overcome, wouldn’t you have to agree with that?, , I would say it’s a challenge. But let’s not forget, in the South in the 1970s and ’80s Democratic senators frequently won overwhelming victories at the same time that George McGovern was cratering in 1972 and Walter Mondale was cratering in 1984 throughout the South. They frequently ran well, well ahead the top of the ticket because they ran their own independent campaigns. That’s what Republican incumbents are doing this year, and it could very well succeed., , How are they doing that, running an independent campaign? Is it stressing certain individual issues? And how do you make a campaign like the Senate, which is usually—you know, you don’t hear as much about when it’s a presidential year, because the presidential race gets all the attention from the free media. How do you lift a campaign up so the Republican voters who might be skeptical about the top of the ticket say, “You know what, I’ve really got to get out there and vote for that Senate candidate”?, ,Three words: Localize, localize, localize. The senators need to make a compelling case that their service in the Senate has made life better for the constituents in their states. And if you look at some of what the candidates are doing—with Marco Rubio on the Zika virus, with Rob Portman about the opiate epidemic in Ohio—you are seeing senators take that lesson to heart. And they are talking about local issues and how their service has made life better for people in their state., , Now I’m also beginning to hear national Republican figures saying if we go into September and Donald Trump is still trailing badly in the polls, that what you’ll see are the national campaign committees shift resources to the House and Senate races. That’s what happened in October, as you know, of 1996 with Bob Dole, when it looked like Dole couldn’t win. Does that have to happen this year as well and how early does it have to happen?, , It may very well happen this year, Paul. We’ll have to talk with the officials in charge of that. But let me give you one data point from 1996. Bob Dole lost to Bill Clinton by 8.5 percentage points. The average Republican House incumbent ran 16 points ahead of Bob Dole in that year and they lost only five seats. There is a record of people doing this in difficult environments, and that’s why I’m more optimistic about the Republicans holding onto the House and the Senate., , But they’re going to spend a lot of money to get out that message in those races., , Yes, they are., , Would you agree with that?, , Of course. Of course., , All right. Whit Ayres, thank you very much for being here. We’ll see if you’re right., , Good to be with you., , When we come back, with the 2016 Olympics wrapping up this weekend, a look at the highs and the lows of the Rio games., , With the 2016 Olympics set to wrap up this weekend, we’re back with a look at the good, the bad and the ugly in Rio.,So, James, what did you like or not about these Olympic Games?, , Well, let’s see, Helen Maroulis, first American Olympic medal in female wrestling, that was a high point., , This is a former wrestler talking here., , That’s your lead, isn’t that what you wanted?, , All politics is local., , Lilly King, swimmer, winning the gold medal and calling out her drugged up competitor, or allegedly, I guess I should say. And I guess we’ll get into the Ryan Lochte story as well. But don’t lie to your mother, I guess, is the No. 1 lesson I get., , All right. Let’s talk about Lochte. We can’t avoid it. Being portrayed, I mean, it looks like he didn’t tell the truth about having been robbed although all the details aren’t clear. This is being taken as an opportunity to talk about the Ugly American and about white male privilege. Jason, are you buying any of that?, , Well, my take-away from this is what we should have learned, or did a long time ago: If you’re going to lie, get your story straight. And if a group of you are going to lie, you all need to be on the same page. This is Lying 101. You’re supposed to learn this in kindergarten., , And also don’t leave video evidence. Kim, isn’t that always a good idea?, , Yes, don’t do it in front of the cameras too., , Kim, do you have any particular memories from the Olympics?, , Well, you know, I mean, I think this has been a kind of clouded Olympics. I mean, we went into it with the news about the Russian doping scandal and that has hung heavy. We’ve had athletes that have been disqualified since they got there because of doping. There has obviously been so many logistical challenges from Rio holding it, which has brought up questions about whether or not you should continue holding events like this in countries that are still working on some of their own infrastructure problems. So, I mean, I think those things have clouded a lot of the otherwise interesting stories about the athletes., , Just to return it to the athletes, Dan, I love the story of the return—the continuing rise of the American distance runner. I mean, for two decades or more we just really didn’t do very well. And now you see them, American distance runners, competing across nearly every race. Jennifer Simpson won the first women’s medal for an American ever in 1,500 meters. And we won steeplechase medals for both men and women. I love that tension in those races between the endurance and the speed at the end. You never know who is going to kick to finally win the race., , Well, you’re talking about the extraordinary training and talent that these athletes display across the board in the Olympics. And I think, to pick up Kim’s point, they need a venue in which they can display those talents. The 2022 Winter Olympics are being held in Beijing, which has no snow. They’re being held there, now listen., , There may be black snow, if they have it., , They’re being held there in part because the Olympics have become too expensive. Sweden, Norway, and Poland pulled their bids for the Winter Olympics because they simply can’t afford it. It’s becoming very difficult to put on a reputable Olympics. And the International Olympic Committee has got to go back to the drawing board about the way they put these Olympics together., , With a goal of what, putting it in one specific location., , Possibly finding one or several venues that are permanent, where people are trained in doing it, where the venues are living up to the standards., , And if the infrastructure can be reused., , That’s the problem. The rich countries—you know, you build these structures, you take on all this debt, and then they become ghost towns at the end. They’re not even used again. And then when you go into a Third World country, or less rich countries, you have a strongman or authoritarian dealing with contractors, enriching themselves, I think a permanent location would allow for the infrastructure to be reused and that would make a lot more economic sense., , But to Kim, and the argument is that if you put it in a permanent location, then that provides a permanent advantage for wherever that is. I mean, I’m not saying if you put it—I mean, so if you put it in Europe, Europeans would have an advantage, you put in Asia, then Asians would have—North America, nobody is going to agree to put it in the United States, I can tell you that. So, I mean, is that really a possible outcome?, , It’s probably not, because, I mean, look at the fighting that goes on now about where the Olympics are going to be held every time and the bidding that goes on. People really care about this. And, I mean, it’s true there have been places that have been pulling their bids because of worries about costs and economics or downturn, but, you know, I think the idea of that and the advantage, I mean, this is one of those things we’ve got to remember that people—countries are very proud to get to hold this in their home places., , All right. Kim, thanks. We have to take one more break. When we come back, “Hits and Misses” of the week., , Time now for our “Hits and Misses” of the week. Kim, start us off., , Paul, the FBI turned over its investigation file on Hillary Clinton to Congress this week. But what’s extraordinary is the high-level security requirements for those in Congress that want to view it. This file is being kept in a secure facility, it has been heavily redacted so that even the people with top security clearances can’t read much of what’s in there. So this is a miss to Jim Comey, the FBI director, for the double standard. If these documents require that much security clearance, then Hillary Clinton ought to be sitting in the dock right now under indictment., , OK. James?, , Paul, this is a hit to the American people for their eminent good sense, or maybe it’s a hit to Barack Obama for inadvertently teaching everyone that government doesn’t work. But we’re talking about the results of a Gallup poll, I think we’re going to show it up on the screen, basically showing what people think of different industries. So this is a net positive rating. The number of people who approve versus disapprove.,You see restaurants, 59%, very strong rating. Computer industry, farming, we put that in there for Kim, very positive view. And even bankers and those people at big oil are more popular than the federal government at minus-27%., , All right, James, thank you. Jason., , This is hit for John McLaughlin, the television personality who died earlier this week. He was sort of the father of combat television journalism. Paul, he taught us how to cut each other off, shout over each other, and he made cable TV news much more entertaining for the viewer, or—, , Wrong! Jason! OK. Dan?, , Paul, amidst the sometimes unreal presidential election, I’d like to draw attention to the reality that people in two parts of the country are fighting the ravages of nature. In California wildfires, some of the most intense ever seen have displaced 82,000 people from their homes. In Louisiana, this extraordinary flood has killed 13 people, destroyed 40,000 homes. So at least we’d like to extend some public sympathy to people trying to survive these two terrible events., , All right. Hear, hear.,And I actually did the McLaughlin show a few times, Jason. That’s back when I had pigment in my hair.,And remember, if you have your own hit or miss be sure to tweet it to us, ,. That’s it for this week’s show. Thanks to my panel and all of you for watching. I’m Paul Gigot. We hope to see you right here next week.,

Now comes the hard part: execution.,“It’s going to be a cleanup role,” said ,Louise Chen,, an analyst for Guggenheim Securities, referring to Mr. Herendeen’s task at the embattled Canadian drugmaker. “The first thing they have to do is string together a couple of good quarters,” she said. ,In his new post, the 60-year-old executive, which Valeant lured away from animal-health giant , , succeeds ,Robert Rosiello,, who will stay on as head of corporate development and strategy. The Wall Street Journal first reported the change in Valeant’s executive lineup on Sunday night. ,Mr. Herendeen’s appointment continued a management shakeup at Valeant, which hired a new chairman and chief executive this spring, named a new general counsel earlier this month, and has expanded its executive committee and given some of its senior executives bigger roles.,On Monday, Valeant’s stock, which traded above $260 a share last year, was at $31.28, up 8.8%, in midafternoon New York trading. The company’s market value fell sharply over the past year as its strategy of acquiring drugs and sharply raising their prices, as well as its accounting practices, came under heavy scrutiny from regulators and investors. ,Earlier this year, Valeant had a close brush with defaulting on some terms of its debt, because it was late to file its annual report. ,The company has since been sued by shareholders and faces an investigation by federal prosecutors into whether it defrauded insurers by obscuring its ties to a mail-order pharmacy that boosted sales of its drugs. Valeant has said it has been cooperating with the investigation. ,In an interview with The Wall Street Journal, Mr. Herendeen said he is walking into Valeant with eyes wide open. “In no way do I want to minimize the challenges facing the company and the potential for other things to go bump in the night,” he said. “As a new team we need to look back and deal with this.”,He emphasized that he took the job because he saw potential in the turnaround effort led by Joseph Papa, who became Valeant’s chief executive in April. ,Mr. Herendeen cited Valeant’s heavy debt burden as an immediate source of concern, because it limits the company’s options. The drugmaker has more than $30 billion of long-term debt on its balance sheet. ,Mr. Papa has said the company will sell assets to reduce its debt load. He has had success in recent weeks amending some terms of that debt to give Valeant more leeway in managing its cash. ,But the company is still struggling with the fallout from its accounting troubles. T. Rowe Price Group Inc. filed a lawsuit against it last week, alleging that Valeant engaged in “a fraudulent scheme” that cost shareholders billions of dollars.,“Valeant intends to defend itself and cannot comment further on ongoing litigation,” a company spokeswoman said of the lawsuit. ,Earlier this month, the company reaffirmed its earnings forecast for the year following a string of reductions, and analysts upgraded their rating of the stock. ,Mutual-fund giant Fidelity has also sharply boosted its stake this year.,Mr. Papa said in an emailed statement that he hired Mr. Herendeen because of his “strong operational focus and disciplined approach to financial management.” Mr. Herendeen, a hockey enthusiast, added that he didn’t leave Zoetis because of any issues with the animal-health company, which he came out of retirement to join two years ago. Rather, he said, success in turning around Valeant could be a capstone to his career., Before his stint as Zoetis’s CFO, Mr. Herendeen was finance chief at drugmaker Warner Chilcott PLC, which he helped sell to Actavis Inc. in 2013. Warner Chilcott was purchased by a consortium of private-equity firms in 2005, and Mr. Herendeen helped manage its debt-heavy balance sheet.,Mr. Herendeen said his selection for the Valeant post follows a summertime interview process that included lengthy conversations with Valeant’s Mr. Papa and Mr. Rosiello. ,Mr. Herendeen shepherded Zoetis through costs cuts, acquisitions and a brush with activist investor ,William Ackman,, who bought into the company in 2014. Mr. Ackman is also an investor in Valeant and a board member, but he didn’t speak directly with Mr. Herendeen about his appointment. ,Shares of Zoetis have risen almost 50% since he joined it. Late on Sunday, the company said it would name ,Glenn David, as its new finance chief. Mr. David had previously served as interim CFO at Zoetis before Mr. Herendeen’s arrival., ,Vipal Monga at , ,

CMO Today: The Story Behind Disney’s Bet on Vice,Steven Perlberg,"This copy is for your personal, non-commercial use only. To order presentation-ready copies for distribution to your colleagues, clients or customers visit http://www.djreprints.com.,http://www.wsj.com/articles/cmo-today-the-story-behind-disneys-bet-on-vice-1472037244, ,: Disney and Vice go together like Mickey Mouse and an Islamic State documentary. But as The Wall Street Journal reports, their tie-up ,, raising questions about whether Disney will just end up acquiring the digital media darling. Disney has an 18% equity stake in Vice, whose last funding round in 2015 gave it a valuation of nearly $4.5 billion. Vice Chief Executive ,Shane Smith, says Vice could be worth $50 billion in three or four years, but the possibility of getting acquired by Disney has certainly dawned on him. “If you look at the brands like Pixar, Marvel and Star Wars that have [sold] to Disney, they have all gotten bigger,” he said. The story dishes dirt on Mr. Smith’s introduction to 21st Century Fox’s ,James Murdoch,, Disney’s early reservations about Vice and how a company filled with 20-something-year-old cord-cutters makes TV shows. It also reveals that Viceland has averaged 45,000 viewers in the key demographic of 18 to 49 year olds, a 51% drop from the A+E channel it replaced. , ,: TV ratings paint a pretty bleak picture when it comes to whether young people, a coveted demographic for marketers, watched the Olympics. In primetime on NBC, the Games averaged 3.6 million viewers age 18 to 34, down more than 30% from London four years ago. But as CMO Today reports, ,—they were just watching differently. This was the first Olympics that NBCU aired events on cable during primetime and streamed every sport live online. NBCU said that nearly 50 million viewers streamed 3.4 billion minutes of Olympics content, and more than half of those people were under the age of 35. Still, NBCU is doing some gold-medal mental gymnastics to prove that millennials watched on linear TV in force, arguing that nearly five times as many young people watched primetime NBC Olympics coverage than watched broadcast TV during the most recent season. The Olympics: more popular than a bunch of sitcoms? Of course., ,: You know when you’re trying to look at a website on your phone and a giant ad pops up that takes up your whole screen? That’s called an “interstitial,” and ,—or at least disincentivized. As CMO Today reports, Google product manager Doantam Phan said in a , on Tuesday that pages that employ interstitials may not rank as highly in Google’s mobile search results starting next year. “Pages that show intrusive interstitials provide a poorer experience to users than other pages where content is immediately accessible,” Mr. Phan wrote. Consumers are increasingly averse to intrusive advertising these days (look no further than the rise of ad blockers), and pressing a tiny “x” to close out of a large pop-up can definitely feel like a poor experience. Google might be doing readers a solid, but it’s also another example of the influence giant tech platforms have on web publishers. , ,: Digital media powerhouse ,, separating into a news department, BuzzFeed News, and a new entertainment unit called BuzzFeed Entertainment Group, Vanity Fair reports, sparking all sorts of speculation about the broader meaning of the split. BuzzFeed CEO Jonah Peretti said that the move is meant to diffuse its video unit across the entire enterprise, as opposed to having a separate video department, which “in 2016 makes about as much sense as having a ‘mobile department.’” The big winner in the shake-up appears to be BuzzFeed Motion Pictures president ,Ze Frank,, who will run the entertainment division. BuzzFeed has pinned its hopes for growth on video and entertainment, while its news reporting unit boosts credibility, if not its bottom line. Mr. Peretti says the company isn’t retreating from news coverage, though the shift toward video can be “scary for people who write for a living.” I’ll say! “Having really great reporters is something that’s valuable to our video-news operation,” he told Vanity Fair.,The New York Times says its Moscow bureau was the target of an attempted cyberattack, but there’s no evidence that the hackers—believed to be Russian—breached the news organization’s internal systems. [,], ,Philippe Dauman,, Viacom’s ousted CEO, has until Sept. 7 to provide the company’s board with a plan to sell a minority stake in the Paramount Pictures film studio. Meanwhile, Mr. Dauman will receive $75 million in exit payments, but if Viacom’s stock performance turns around after he leaves, it could push that package well past $100 million. [,, ,],WPP PLC shares rose this morning after the world’s largest advertising company posted 4.3% growth in comparable net sales, at the top of its peer group. But CEO ,Martin Sorrell, said he remains cautious. Advertisers are cutting costs, the impact of Brexit isn’t fully known and WPP took a write-down on its investment in comScore.

This can be problematic on mobile devices where screens are often smaller.”,As a result, pages where content is not easily accessible to a user on the transition from mobile search results may not rank as highly in Google’s search results after Jan. 10, 2017, the post said. This could result in less traffic to those pages and sites.,Examples of interstitials that make content less accessible include pop-ups that “cover the main content [of a page], either immediately after the user navigates to a page from the search results, or while they are looking through the page,” Mr. Phan wrote.,Google said in September 2015 that it would begin penalizing ,, which might encourage a user to download a site’s app rather than viewing content on the mobile web. The new update appears to be casting the net a lot wider and targeting a much broader variety of interstitial formats.,It’s unclear exactly what type of interstitials Google will penalize, or how drastically, but the tweak could have implications for many major websites. ,Interstitials for age-verification purposes or asking permission to drop small pieces of code known as “cookies” on users’ devices will not be affected, however. Website owners will also not be penalized for placing banner ads on their pages as long as they use “a reasonable amount of screen space,” according to the blog post., ,Jack Marshall at , ,

Your Screen-Time Rules or Mine?,Sue Shellenbarger,"This copy is for your personal, non-commercial use only. To order presentation-ready copies for distribution to your colleagues, clients or customers visit http://www.djreprints.com.,http://www.wsj.com/articles/your-screen-time-rules-or-mine-1471972582,It can be a sticky situation for parents: Your 8-year-old’s new friend plays videogames for several hours every day, but you set tight limits on your own child’s screen time. Or your 9-year-old’s friends all use Instagram on their cellphones, years before you intend to even let your daughter have a phone. Can you control what happens on a play date?,While ,, they often seem especially divergent when it comes to children’s media use. What’s available for children, and what’s popular, changes all the time. And parents have differing levels of comfort and familiarity with new platforms.,Heather Dooley Pecor doesn’t allow her 12-year-old daughter, Wilhelmina, to open Snapchat or Instagram accounts, as her friends have done. Ms. Dooley Pecor and her husband, Sean, of Cary, N.C., closely monitor Wilhelmina’s use of social media, and Ms. Pecor has looked at Instagram and seen content she doesn’t think is appropriate for a 12-year-old. She doesn’t prevent her daughter from visiting friends who use the apps, however, because she wants her to have a normal social life. ,Ms. Pecor was dismayed recently when she discovered Wilhelmina had opened an Instagram account on a friend’s phone while attending a sleepover, she says. She had her close the account and told Wilhelmina she has to wait a little longer to start using the app. Ms. Pecor, who blogs at GallantGirls.com, says, “I don’t feel like I should criticize someone else’s parenting,” but she looks for opportunities to explain her concerns to other parents. ,It’s fairly , when they’re small. Parents tend to socialize with others who have the same rules at this stage, and pick their children’s friends. It’s usually fine at this stage to tell another parent before a play date, “I know some children love to play videogames. That’s not something we do,” and to suggest alternatives, such as meeting at the park, says ,Katie Hurley,, a clinical social worker in Los Angeles and author of “The Happy Kid Handbook.” ,Tensions rise in elementary school as children spend more screen time on a wider range of devices, experiment with new uses for technology and begin using online resources for school. Parents’ rules often diverge widely at this stage. “There are 9-year-olds with smartphones and 15-year-olds who don’t have them yet,” Ms. Hurley says.,Parents at this stage usually shouldn’t insist that their rules be followed in other parents’ homes, says ,Yalda T. Uhls,, a research psychologist with the Children’s Digital Media Center at the University of California, Los Angeles. It isn’t wise to forbid your child from using the apps or games their friends find enthralling either, because this “can create a sense of longing” and make your child want to use them even more, says Dr. Uhls, author of “Media Moms and Digital Dads.”,Shana Russell says her limits on technology use by her three daughters—13, 18 and 22—have long been more permissive than most parents’. The girls all had cellphones by age 8 and used social media earlier than their friends. Ms. Russell allows them to make and post playful, funny home videos on YouTube. The Friendswood, Texas, high-school technology specialist says she wants them to “experience as much as they can and make their mistakes while they’re still under my watch.” ,She tries to abide by other parents’ rules when their children visit her home, but she often learns about them secondhand—from her children, social media or overhearing parents’ conversations with others, says Ms. Russell, who blogs at HiTechMom.com. She also asks other parents about their rules before their children visit her home. When one mother told Ms. Russell recently that she wasn’t comfortable with her daughter making and posting videos, Ms. Russell didn’t allow it during the daughter’s visit. ,Enrolling in , can provide an opportunity to discuss parental rules in a neutral setting, says ,Jane Nelsen,, a San Diego marriage, family and child therapist and author of more than 20 books on positive discipline for children. ,If your child’s friends are playing Pokémon Go and you haven’t permitted your child to download the app, ask other parents whether they accompany their children while playing, or how far they let them roam in search of the game’s virtual-reality creatures. Knowing the minimum age limits set by films and game makers can strengthen your case for stricter rules. Most social-media platforms require users to be at least 13, although the rules are widely ignored. ,Chandri Navarro set aside her strict daily limits on screen time while her three daughters were on vacation when her now 19-year-old and 17-year-old twins were in elementary school. The family vacationed with cousins who were avid gamers. Ms. Navarro bought the girls hand-held video players with several adventure games, so the children could play together on car trips. “I wanted them to have a normal childhood. I didn’t want them to be the weird kids,” she says. The girls played the games during the vacation but lost interest after resuming their usual routines at home including dance, soccer, voice lessons and schoolwork, says Ms. Navarro, of Alexandria, Va. ,Ms. Navarro’s 19-year-old, Bianca Navarro-Bowman, says she remembers feeling left out as a child when her friends talked about TV shows she hadn’t seen. She doesn’t use social media as much as her peers, but feels just as competent in using it, she says. ,There were benefits from her mother’s rules, such as leaving ample time for creative pursuits, Ms. Navarro-Bowman says. “We were always painting and drawing, making up dances and singing songs.” ,Dr. Nelsen advises holding family meetings to discuss screen-time limits and getting children involved solving any problems they cause. Listen to their views and explain your values, she says. When using your own phone and other devices, model the behavior you want your children to learn.,“The best thing is to instill in your child a sense of what is appropriate and inappropriate,” enabling them to manage their own behavior outside the home, Dr. Uhls says.,Mayee Futterman, of Encino, Calif., taught her son Jake starting in preschool to balance screen time with outdoor play, artwork, reading and other activities. Her goal was “to instill values at a very early age and teach him to make his own decisions,” she says. ,Now 13, Jake loves computer games but he’s also busy with homework, sports, playing the guitar and robotics. When he recently spent a night at the home of a friend who enjoyed playing videogames for hours, Ms. Futterman says, Jake was able to persuade the boy to play outside.,Jake says he enjoys playing Civilization V, currently his favorite videogame, to relax and have fun after school or after finishing his homework. He knows some teens “who would be happy to play the game all day long,” he says. But after a couple of hours of videogames, “I just get bored, and it’s just not fun any more. At that point, I’ll go read a book, or do other relaxing things,” he says. , ,Sue Shellenbarger at , ,

NBC Argues Millennials Did Watch the Olympics—Just Not All on Traditional TV,Steven Perlberg,"This copy is for your personal, non-commercial use only. To order presentation-ready copies for distribution to your colleagues, clients or customers visit http://www.djreprints.com.,http://www.wsj.com/articles/nbc-argues-millennials-did-watch-the-olympicsjust-not-all-on-traditional-tv-1471969286,Traditional TV ratings for the Rio Olympics ,, particularly among young viewers, but NBC is on a mission to prove that millennials still watched the Games.,The Rio Olympics averaged 3.6 million viewers age 18 to 34 in primetime on NBC, down more than 30% from the 2012 Summer Games in London.,But NBCUniversal, a unit of Comcast Corp., has maintained those ratings only tell part of the story, since this year’s event also aired on cable networks in primetime and all content was available to stream live, even when some of those events didn’t air on TV until the evening.,According to NBCU, nearly 50 million viewers streamed 3.4 billion minutes across the web and on mobile and connected devices, with more than half of streamers under the age of 35. That compares with almost 200 million viewers in aggregate who watched the Games across NBCU’s TV networks during the 17 days of coverage. ,“We’re all willing to acknowledge that the composition of those watching linear television on a TV set has shifted somewhat,” said Gary Zenkel, president of NBC Olympics. “Like many things, the Olympics is being viewed on other platforms.”,As viewers migrate to other platforms, the challenge for the entire TV industry has been to figure out how to make money at the same rate—particularly with viewing habits shifting the fastest among the younger demographic coveted by advertisers. With the Rio Olympics, about 10% of NBCU’s total ad sales efforts were tied to streaming deals.,The company has said that advertisers committed to spend more than $1.2 billion on commercials in advance of the Games, with another $30 million flowing in during the events.,NBC’s viewership among young audiences may have declined from four years ago, but the company was more interested in pointing out that the Olympics are still more popular now than whatever is on broadcast TV. The company noted that nearly five times as many millennials watched primetime Olympics coverage on NBC when compared with the average viewership during the most recent broadcast TV season. In short, millennials were willing to tune into the Summer Olympics, a massive quadrennial sporting event, more than they did for standard sitcoms and dramas on TV every night. (That doesn’t seem too surprising.),Mark Lazarus, chairman of NBC Sports Group, acknowledged that the statistic is “not the only benchmark,” but said that “this Games was the most dominant against our competition.”,NBCU is spending more than $12 billion to air the Olympics from 2014 through 2032, a massive bet that puts pressure on the media giant to deliver huge audiences. ,When it comes to young viewers, NBCU also boasted about the Olympics’ prominence on social media. The company generated more than 600 million video views of NBC Olympics Facebook video, and created 160 Facebook Live videos. On Snapchat—a ,—nearly 33 million consumers viewed Olympics content. NBC Sports’ YouTube subscribers increased sevenfold during the Games.,Mr. Lazarus said that while the social media numbers were large, the biggest challenge is ensuring the company can draw revenue from those audiences. “A lot of young people followed the Games, it’s how many of those can we convert to watching the Games,” he said.,With young consumers’ viewing habits fast changing and cord-cutting on the rise, one question is whether NBC might in the future offer a stand-alone, direct-to-consumer Olympics streaming package. Mr. Lazarus said the network has a lot of data to crunch over the next few months, and while he didn’t think the network will move it that direction right now, it’s possible in the future.,“We do have the right to do it. I don’t rule it out,” Mr. Lazarus said., ,Steven Perlberg at , ,

CMO Today: Sponsors Cut Ties with Ryan Lochte,Steven Perlberg,"This copy is for your personal, non-commercial use only. To order presentation-ready copies for distribution to your colleagues, clients or customers visit http://www.djreprints.com.,http://www.wsj.com/articles/cmo-today-sponsors-cut-ties-with-ryan-lochte-1471950640, ,: It’s a story as old as time: a celebrity does something bad and the sponsors go running. Well, it’s not exactly ,, but swimwear apparel company Speedo USA felt the pressure from Ryan Lochte’s Rio robbery scandal and was the first sponsor to ,, CMO Today reports. “We cannot condone behavior that is counter to the values this brand has long stood for,” Speedo said in a statement. The domino fell to another sponsor, Ralph Lauren, who said that its endorsement agreement with Mr. Lochte, which was specifically for the Rio Olympics, won't be renewed. Then the lesser-known brands, like mattress manufacturer Airweave and Gentle Hair Removal, also parted ways with the swimmer. Mr. Lochte, who won gold in Rio as part of the men’s 4x200m relay, will face an uphill—or upstream, as it were—battle if he wants to get back in the good graces of marketers., ,: The end of Gawker.com, brought about by a sex tape, a professional wrestler, a drawn-out legal case with a $140 million penalty and a billionaire with a grudge, “is a fitting conclusion to this experiment in what happens when you let journalists say what they really think,” Gawker founder ,Nick Denton, , on Monday. “Gawker’s demise turns out to be the ultimate Gawker story. It shows how things work,” Mr. Denton said. While Gawker.com was left behind in bankruptcy, the parent company’s other properties are headed to Univision, and Mr. Denton , for the next two years (about $400,000) to not compete with the sites. Meanwhile, in another strange twist, Charles Harder, a lawyer who represented Hulk Hogan in his suit against Gawker, is , as she threatens legal action against the Daily Mail and other news outlets for defamation, Politico reports. It’s too bad Gawker isn’t around to write about it., ,: The alcohol industry has a new marketing challenge: ,. As The Wall Street Journal reports, public-health officials in multiple countries who once said a little booze had modest coronary and other health benefits are scrutinizing those claims as research emerges about alcohol’s links to cancer. Alcohol lobbyists, for their part, are funding their own research, but what governments ultimately suggest can have huge reverberations—just ask tobacco executives. Rule changes could affect how alcohol companies are allowed to advertise their products, if at all. In Australia, for instance, alcohol consumption fell once the government advised less drinking in 2009. , ,: NBC and CBS are splitting “Thursday Night Football” games this season, but as Variety reports, , that its games are more valuable. Why? Because its games are closer to the holiday season when marketers need to get their message out. The NFL tried to schedule matchups with equal appeal, and Variety notes both networks are looking for between $550,000 and $590,000 for a 30-second ad. For CBS’s part, the network wanted a package of early games, so it could promote its primetime lineup to a massive live audience. For now it’s unclear whether NBC will be able to negotiate a premium or not. ,Facebook is going to roll out a new feature that allows for two-person broadcasts on Facebook Live. The feature would allow two people to broadcast together and share the screen.

Power.,As ,, about 60% of streaming customers still purchase some form of paid-TV service, according to the study, while 23% are “cord shavers” that have slimmed down their bundle. About 13% have cut the cable cord and 4% have never subscribed to pay TV and rely exclusively on streaming, according to the study, based on responses from nearly 4,000 customers during June and July. ,But consumer “satisfaction” for streaming services, such as Hulu, Netflix and Amazon Prime Instant Video, vary across these groups. Those who have cable packages are happiest about their streaming services, while satisfaction is lowest among cord cutters, closely followed by “cord nevers.” While streaming services are certainly growing and reshaping the television industry, the results suggest consumers might still think of them as a complement to pay TV, according to ,Kirk Parsons,, senior director and technology, media and telecom practice leader at J.D. Power.,Mr. Parsons said that there was a “halo effect,” and that cable subscribers who also use streaming services “have the best of both worlds,” since original programming on services like Netflix helps fill in the gaps of traditional TV.,“Even though you may be paying more, you’re getting more for it,” Mr. Parsons said. ,And, presumably, some people who are cord-cutters might be frustrated when they find out their streaming services don’t air TV shows they like.,Unsurprisingly, consumers that favor streaming are younger than those that also subscribe to cable. About 37% of consumers that only use streaming services are 18 to 34 years old, a ,., ,Steven Perlberg at , ,

CMO Today: Paramount Prepares Turnaround Pitch for Viacom Board,Steven Perlberg,"This copy is for your personal, non-commercial use only. To order presentation-ready copies for distribution to your colleagues, clients or customers visit http://www.djreprints.com.,http://www.wsj.com/articles/cmo-today-paramount-prepares-turnaround-pitch-for-viacom-board-1472123336, ,: Brad Grey, chief executive of beleaguered film studio Paramount Pictures, is about to have one very important meeting. As The Wall Street Journal reports, the studio head will have to , to parent company Viacom’s newly expanded board. The film unit, whose most recent release “Ben-Hur” flopped at the box office, has been a drag on earnings and a consistent concern for Viacom investors. People close to Shari Redstone, a board member and the daughter of controlling shareholder Sumner Redstone, say she has expressed concerns about current leadership. Mr. Grey, at the helm for 11 years, renewed his contract last year through 2020, and Viacom’s interim CEO ,Tom Dooley, said “there is no consideration of replacing him.” Though, Mr. Dooley is only in charge through September with no guarantee of landing the permanent gig. Another option still on the table is the sale of a minority stake in the studio. The potential move was put on hold during the boardroom drama in recent months, but former CEO ,Philippe Dauman, will still get the chance to present a plan for the stake sale in the coming weeks., ,: Publishers have been diving into Facebook video to create viral hits for themselves, and increasingly, on behalf of brands. But as CMO Today reports, publishers are getting anxious ,. In April, the social network began requiring companies to label videos paid for by brands, and now media executives are worried Facebook will restrict sponsored videos in users’ feeds, effectively forcing media companies to buy ads to drive viewership. Some say you already need to buy ads so that Facebook will offer better analytics on how videos perform. For its part, Facebook says it doesn’t have plans to take a cut of revenue from branded content deals and that it doesn’t penalize sponsored videos. That hasn’t quelled the Facebook Kremlinology, as one executive described it, particularly given that the company has been reaching out to publishers to make sure videos mentioning a brand are properly tagged., ,: ESPN reigns in the world of sports media, but two of its most well-known rivals are ,. As CMO Today reports, Time Inc.’s Sports Illustrated and 21st Century Fox’s Fox Sports will share significant editorial content and allow their ad sales teams to sell across both properties. Sports Illustrated offers news-breaking articles at a time when Fox Sports has pivoted its focus to personality-driven opinion, while Fox Sports has a boatload of video and rights deals with major leagues ripe for syndication across Sports Illustrated’s properties. In a maneuver known as “traffic assignment,” the companies are combining their comScore-measured traffic, effectively making the duo second to ESPN in the sports media rankings. Together, they’re hoping they can have the heft necessary to pique the interest of media buyers. “Scale really matters in this business,” said Rich Battista, president of Time Inc. Brands., ,: The conventional wisdom is that digital media companies are vying to get on television at a time when television companies are trying to understand digital media. Think Vice, BuzzFeed and Vox, and their various tie-ups with traditional media companies. Another such digital company is Thrillist, a male-focused digital media publisher whose CEO ,Ben Lerer, ,. “There are not all that many brands that really matter from a digital perspective,” Mr. Lerer said. “And I think the TV companies are generally not perfectly positioned right now to thrive in digital because of the cost structures they have set up and the fact that they have to spend so much time and energy defensively protecting their turf.” Mr. Lerer argues that TV provides an opportunity for traditional and new media companies to link up “naturally,” since “both sides respect each other.” Check out the episode and subscribe on ,, ,, , or Stitcher.,ESPN’s Outside the Lines has a deep dive into the legal saga of DraftKings and FanDuel, the once high-flying daily fantasy sites beset with regulatory scrutiny and legal fees. The two companies are heading into a new football season, but in a very different state than last year. [,],Vice CEO ,Shane Smith, predicted a “bloodbath” in media consolidation in the next year and said that selling his digital media company to Disney “makes sense.” Disney already owns 18% of Vice. [,],WPP has increased its stake in measurement company comScore from 18.6% to 19.2% since June 30. But the ad giant took a write-down on its investment in comScore amid the company’s executive shake-up after accounting issues came to light. [,],Facebook is looking to expand its ad network, called Audience Network, and is testing a complicated and increasingly popular ad tech process called “header bidding.” [,],Upstart political Facebook pages have thrived during this election season, posting cheaply produced memes and videos as mainstream publishers struggle to figure out what works on Facebook.

"With Perry Como’s Music, Dig Deeper Than ‘Hot Diggity’",Terry Teachout,"Sixty years ago, Perry Como cut a hit record of the dumbest song ever written. O.K., maybe not quite ever, but “Hot Diggity (Dog Ziggity Boom),” a stupefyingly banal novelty tune, surely ranks right up there. I place in evidence Dick Manning’s lyrics: “Hot diggity, dog ziggity, boom / What you do to me, / When you’re holding me tight.” Recorded on Feb. 2, 1956, “Hot Diggity” shot straight to the top of the charts and stayed there until Elvis Presley’s “Heartbreak Hotel” shoved it aside. Its success says much about what American pop music was like between the end of the big-band era and the rise of rock ’n’ roll.,

The measurement firm has not released any financial statements related to its 2015 results, due to an internal investigation by its audit committee, WPP said. ComScore said Aug. 10 that it would be replacing its chief executive.,That turmoil hasn’t deterred WPP from increasing its stake in the company. A day after the CEO change was announced, WPP bought more shares and has raised its stake from 18.6% on June 30th to 19.2% as of Tuesday. When it announced its initial investment in February 2015, WPP said it would aim to acquire a 15-20% stake in comScore. ,“The Group continues to monitor the position and welcomes the most recent management changes, although remains puzzled as to why the audit investigation has taken so long, remains unresolved and has proved so costly,” WPP said in its earnings presentation. Results of the investigation are expected in the second half of the year.,WPP in the second quarter reported comparable net sales, which strips out acquisitions, disposals and currency effects, of 4.3%, beating analyst expectations and sending shares up more than 5%. ,The holding company owns ad and media agencies, as well as data companies, including J. Walter Thompson, Grey, media agency network GroupM and Kantar, among others.,Net new business wins in the first half of the year were about $3 billion in billings, compared with $2.08 billion during the same period last year. ,WPP lost its massive , , account to rival , , this month, but the loss likely won’t make a dent until later in the year. AT&T consolidated its media and creative agency accounts with Omnicom following its acquisition of DirecTV. ,AT&T alone reported an advertising expense of $3.63 billion in 2015. Omnicom’s BBDO retained the creative business, and the holding company’s newly created media agency, Hearts & Science, gained the massive media account. Losing the business is WPP’s MEC, which had handled the AT&T media business, as well as DirecTV creative shop Grey.,The value of the account to WPP was under $100 million, amounting to a 0.5% headwind, according to a note from Pivotal Research Senior Analyst Brian Wieser.,AT&T was one of the rare giants to review its media agency business this year, as most large accounts went up for review in 2015, during a period often referred to as “reviewmageddon.” ,“What we’re seeing is not so much an increase in [review] activity, but an increase in media audits,” said WPP CEO ,Martin Sorrell., ,He referenced the launch of new media specialty groups at audit firms K2 and Ebiquity. The Association of National Advertisers hired the two firms last October to investigate media buying practices and behavior -- specifically whether or not media agencies are collecting rebates in the U.S. ,Some large marketers have brought digital buying operations in-house to improve transparency or control over their data, but GroupM’s North America CEO Brian Lesser said that the trend isn’t hitting its Xaxis programmatic unit. ,“What we’re not seeing is a trend toward clients bringing programmatic in-house,” he said.,WPP also continued to increase spending with Google and , , largely due to an increase in spending on mobile search as mobile search overtakes desktop search in terms of volume. The company this year expects to spend about $5.5 billion with Google, compared with $4 billion last year, and $1.7 billion with Facebook, compared with $1 billion last year, Mr. Sorrell said.,Still, the company emphasized the need for a third major online player to create more of a balance in power beyond the ad and measurement “duopoly.” , , coming off acquisitions of , , and AOL, could be that third player, Mr. Sorrell said. , ,Alexandra Bruell at , ,

Some Publishers Worry About Viability of Branded Videos on Facebook,Mike Shields,"This copy is for your personal, non-commercial use only. To order presentation-ready copies for distribution to your colleagues, clients or customers visit http://www.djreprints.com.,http://www.wsj.com/articles/some-publishers-worry-about-viability-of-branded-videos-on-facebook-1472059615,Media companies are amassing , , allowing them to make more money from producing and distributing videos paid for by advertisers. ,But the more popular video becomes on the social network, the more some publishers worry about how Facebook’s policies will evolve regarding such branded content videos.,Weaving sponsor mentions into videos or creating content specifically for marketers has become the primary source of revenue for publishers on the site because Facebook doesn’t take a cut of the revenue generated from such clips and it doesn’t allow pre-roll advertising like YouTube.,Facebook has a history of adjusting policies as it goes, like when it began requiring publishers in April to label videos paid for by sponsors, or when it announced in June that it would begin ,. Because of that track record, some media companies have grown anxious that Facebook will change the way branded videos can be distributed or tweak the rules around paid advertising. As one publisher put it, a “reasonable paranoia” has set in.,The degree of worry depends on how reliant a given publisher is on Facebook for its audience. “All it takes is a slight tweak to the algorithm or to the business rules. And if you’re 100% dependent, the walls come down,” said Anthony Iaffaldano, vice president of corporate marketing at Business Insider.,Among the chief concerns some publishers have is whether sponsored videos will be penalized by Facebook’s algorithm, forcing them to buy ads to drive viewership to their videos clips.,Others grumble that regardless of the algorithm, they have to buy ads to promote their brand-funded videos in order to provide advertisers with a rich set of data and analytics on how these videos perform and what audiences they reach. They say such data isn’t available for the average “organic” Facebook video.,“Facebook is incentivized to give more data to the folks who are paying directly,” said Mr. Iaffaldano.,Facebook has responded by trying to calm the range of concerns. The company says that when publishers identify their videos as being sponsored, Facebook’s algorithm doesn’t penalize them. In addition, Facebook said it has heard publishers’ desires for more advanced data and analytics for branded content videos and is taking the matter under consideration.,There’s also the persistent fear that, eventually, Facebook won’t let publishers make branded videos for its platform without requiring them to share revenue. The prices for branded content deals range widely, anywhere from five-figures to half a million dollars, based on how much original video footage is produced, say publishers.,Facebook says it has no plans to take a cut of the revenue from branded content deals.,Regardless, Facebook’s history of opaque communications causes “endless Kremlinology” among publishers, said Eli Pariser, chief executive at the feel-good social publisher Upworthy. That said, he’s confident that Facebook wants media companies to thrive.,“They want high-quality content for their experience, and publishers need to reach an audience and provide the metrics advertisers want,” Mr. Pariser said.,LittleThings, a publisher known for feel-good stories, started selling branded content videos in April. Thrivent Financial, for instance, funded a video on summer travel trips that is nearing 1 million views since August 18.,LittleThings Chief Operating Officer Gretchen Tibbits said the company generated 234 million views in July on Facebook—two-thirds of its total video views. The company is acutely aware it’s living on someone else’s platform. ,“We all know that we don’t actually always know when Facebook changes its algorithm,” Ms. Tibbits said. “We think it’s happened twice this summer.”,Some publishers’ paranoia has been fueled by the increased attention Facebook is paying to branded content. Since it required the new labeling earlier this year, Facebook has been notifying publishers when their videos mention products and making sure that videos paid for by advertisers are correctly identified, according to people familiar with the matter.,For now, many publishers are confident in their ability to make videos that their audiences want to watch and share, while also making their ad partners happy. There are plenty of examples of branded videos performing well on Facebook, such as a recent clip from the digital publisher NowThis sponsored by Kleenex featuring a man who gives free haircuts to the homeless, which has generated 9.3 million views. Meanwhile, a clip produced for , , by Upworthy generated 2.8 million views., ,Mike Shields at , ,

Take, for example, her brief on the Yellow Sea’s Shandong Province, one of the origins of the maritime Silk Road and land of toffee apples, yellow-braised duck and Confucius: “The Great Sage…had much to say about food, as when he pointed out that ‘the way you cut your meat reflects the way you live.’ ” , , , ,Samarkand might sound like a fictitious place, a desert oasis dreamed up by an ancient poet or a dissolute 1940s Hollywood screenwriter who envisioned mosques topped with turquoise tiles and camel caravans loaded with golden peaches. But Samarkand is real all right—it’s the third largest city in Uzbekistan, and served as one of the key waypoints along the ancient Silk Road. This vividly photographed cookbook examines the culinary influences of the historic trade route that brought fragrant Persian rice plovs, Russian meat dishes and European herbs together in Central Asian cooking. The recipes here, a mix of traditional dishes and modern iterations, are surprisingly approachable. Most call for familiar ingredients used in pleasantly disorienting combinations: seared lamb chops paired with tangy sour cherries, young potatoes dusted with cinnamon and cardamom. Those with risk-taking palates can make the vivid-green tarragon soda (a regional favorite) and serve it with an eggplant-cheese purée called “Sultan’s delight” and a roasted mutton. Not wildly fond of mutton? Lamb chops will do just fine. , , , ,A veteran of the cookbook-cum-travel memoir genre, author Naomi Duguid introduced food lovers to places like Tibet and Myanmar in earlier volumes. For her latest book—due in September—she traveled to the countries that once made up the Persian Empire, weaving recipes together with colorful firsthand accounts of her travels. In Kurdistan, an autonomous region in Iraq, she stays with a friend’s family who teach her to make “kerchief flatbreads”—paper-thin and cooked on a domed griddle. In Azerbaijan, she shares an impromptu picnic of lamb and mulberry vodka with locals near an apple orchard. And in a vineyard in Georgia, Ms. Duguid discovers that veal kebabs taste even better when grilled over grapevine clippings, and pair exceedingly well with cheese-filled bread and rich Georgian wine. , ,

Thrillist CEO Says TV and Digital Media Companies Can Learn From Each Other,Jack Marshall,"This copy is for your personal, non-commercial use only.

At the same time, digital media upstarts are increasingly eyeing TV.,Ben Lerer, chief executive of digital publisher Thrillist, believes TV and digital companies can learn a lot from each other, and partnerships between the two camps increasingly make sense.,“I honestly think TV is the first place where you can see truly natural partnerships between traditional and digital [companies] where both sides respect each other,” ,Mr. Lerer, said during this week’s ,.,“Digital respects the fact they don’t know how to make TV and, speaking for myself, I really respect having conversations with traditional TV folks. They know a bunch of stuff I don’t know about that medium, but they respect the fact that we have a brand that resonates with an audience that isn’t currently tuning into them, and that we represent something they covet,” he said.,Thrillist, a male-focused digital lifestyle publisher, has engaged in conversations with TV companies but doesn’t currently have any formal partnerships in place, Mr. Lerer said.,Many digital media companies now have their eyes set on TV. BuzzFeed, which received an investment from Comcast Corp.’s NBCUniversal last year, , to bring its brand to TV, and Refinery29 , Time Warner Inc.’s Turner on TV content. Vice, which counts Walt Disney Co. as a major investor, ,.,But according to Mr. Lerer, the market isn’t as crowded as it might seem. What’s more, TV companies are thirsting for opportunities.,“You can look at it from the perspective that there are a lot of digital media brands who want to do [TV], but are there really that many?” he said. “There are not all that many brands that really matter from a digital perspective, and I think the TV companies are generally not perfectly positioned right now to thrive in digital because of the cost structures they have set up, and the fact that they have to spend so much time and energy defensively protecting their turf.”,For more from Mr. Lerer, check out the episode and subscribe on ,, ,, , or Stitcher., ,Jack Marshall at , ,

Sports Illustrated Teams Up With Fox Sports for Ad Deal,Steven Perlberg,"This copy is for your personal, non-commercial use only.

Brands.,A breaking news article from Sports Illustrated might also get posted to Fox Sports’ site, for example, while Fox could syndicate video highlights to Sports Illustrated’s properties.,Meanwhile, the ad sales units from Sports Illustrated and Fox Sports will be able to sell advertising across both entities, and the two companies will share in the revenue. They declined to disclose specific financial details.,Combined properties operated by Sports Illustrated and Fox Sports brought in about 68 million unique visitors in July, which would make it the second-largest sports publisher behind ESPN, which brought in about 79 million visitors, according to digital measurement specialist comScore.,On their own, Fox Sports ranked third in the sports category in July, while Sports Illustrated came in 10th, according to comScore.,“Scale really matters in this business,” Mr. Battista said.,The deal comes as Fox Sports 1, a network launched as a competitor to ESPN in 2013, retools its programming to ,. “As we’ve scaled back because we don’t believe in highlights and news as TV programming, that’s also created a little bit of a hole on the digital side,” said Pete Vlastelica, executive vice president of digital for Fox Sports.,Adding Sports Illustrated articles written by “journalists with a capital J” will help address that shortfall, Mr. Vlastelica said. “Fox Sports’ digital editorial strategy has been driven by shareable social news and short-form social video. We’re not newsbreakers necessarily.”,The pair also will work together on editorial projects, and Mr. Vlastelica said they are kicking around ideas surrounding the Sports Illustrated swimsuit edition, NFL football and U.S. Open golf.,Though they will remain separate websites, Sports Illustrated and Fox Sports will combine their comScore web traffic under a yet-to-be-named brand, which will be considered a part of Time Inc.’s overall traffic. Media companies often place their comScore-measured digital audience with another publication through this process, known as “traffic assignment.”,It’s far from clear whether the tie-up will resonate with media buyers. “They have great content, but it’s very difficult to compete for eyeballs right now in the sports space,” said Niki DeCou, vice president and brand group director at Horizon Media. ,Ms. DeCou said she’ll be curious to see if the greater scale from the deal results in a price drop for video advertising, which she said is expensive right now at both companies because they have less inventory to sell than ESPN.,The deal also marks one of the first major moves by Mr. Battista, who joined Time Inc. last year and was , last month. (Earlier in his career, Mr. Battista worked at Fox.) The Journal reported earlier this month that Time Inc. was planning to ,. Five people were let go at Sports Illustrated in recent days, according to a person familiar with the matter.,21st Century Fox and , , parent company of The Wall Street Journal, share common ownership., ,Steven Perlberg at , ,

But even as he has sought to appease critics, who have attacked his proposals as inhumane and impractical, his signals have been dividing his closest allies and prompting warnings he could lose core supporters if he abandons the signature issue of his campaign.

CMO Today: Why Marketing Tech Is Beating Out Ad Tech,Steven Perlberg,"This copy is for your personal, non-commercial use only. To order presentation-ready copies for distribution to your colleagues, clients or customers visit http://www.djreprints.com.,http://www.wsj.com/articles/cmo-today-why-marketing-tech-is-beating-out-ad-tech-1472210085, ,: Marketing tech and ad tech. They sound similar, but in the eyes of the venture capitals, the ,. As CMO Today reports, U.S. venture-capital firms invested around $860 million in ad tech firms last year, the lowest since 2010, and it’s on pace to be even lower this year, according to PitchBook. Marketing tech companies, however, received more than $1.2 billion in funding last year. To put it simply, ad tech companies generally collect revenue on the volume of advertising they buy for clients, whereas marketing tech companies often sell software directly to brands. The software-as-a-service model means recurring, more predictable revenue, which is more attractive to VCs. Plus, there are only a handful of potential buyers for ad tech companies, and those that have gone public have struggled in the market lately. Some say it just comes down to semantics. “Ad tech has gone out of favor so everybody is rebranding themselves as martech. It’s old wine in a new bottle,” said Venky Ganesan, managing director at venture-capital firm Menlo Partners., ,: In 2014, , , shocked the tech world by dropping $19 billion for messaging service WhatsApp. Now Facebook’s plan to make money through the service is coming into sharper focus. As The Wall Street Journal reports, WhatsApp will ,. That information will help ad targeting on Facebook’s terrain and pave the way for users to communicate with businesses within WhatsApp, which has more than a billion users. Facebook has started to experiment with users connecting with businesses on its own Messenger service. While its data will help Facebook’s ad capabilities, WhatsApp said that its own app would still offer “an experience without third-party banner ads and spam.” But that doesn’t mean the privacy concerns won’t agitate users., ,: Summertime means belt-tightening time in the magazine business. As Women’s Wear Daily reports, staffers at Condé Nast are ,, particularly a slimming down of its roster of publishers. That strategy is similar to rival Time Inc.’s recent shuffling, which ,. The Journal reported last month that Time Inc. was , across the company. This week, Time Inc.’s Sports Illustrated ,with Fox Sports, as magazine publishers search for ways to beef up their digital presences—even if that means linking up with “rivals” to do so. And, as WWD noted last month, magazine company ,, to cope with a pullback in fall advertising., ,: You know what they say: when one door closes after an international scandal brought on by a debunked account of late-night drunken robbery, another opens.

Why Venture Capitalists Are Betting on Marketing Tech Over Ad Tech,Jack Marshall,"This copy is for your personal, non-commercial use only. To order presentation-ready copies for distribution to your colleagues, clients or customers visit http://www.djreprints.com.,http://www.wsj.com/articles/why-venture-capitalists-are-betting-on-marketing-tech-over-ad-tech-1472202000,If you’re trying to secure millions of dollars in venture capital, these days it may be better to pitch your business as “marketing tech” rather than “ad tech.”,It has , for advertising technology companies to raise money in recent years, but funding for companies in the closely-related marketing technology sector appears to be as healthy as ever.,U.S. venture-capital firms invested around $860 million in ad tech firms last year, the lowest amount since 2010 and down considerably from a peak of more than $2.7 billion in 2011, according to venture capital and private equity data company PitchBook. So far this year, only $446 million has been committed, on pace for the lowest funding level since 2005.,But PitchBook data suggest U.S. venture capital investment for marketing technology companies has been steadier, reaching over $1.2 billion last year. Investment this year was already close to $1 billion by Aug. 23, according to PitchBook, on pace to surpass last year.,Why the divergence? One key factor is the business models that power these companies, venture capitalists say.,Advertising technology took off on the promise to automate the buying and targeting of ads across the web. Such companies have typically relied on “media-based” business models, whereby they collect revenue based on the volume of advertising they purchase and place on behalf of clients. They often sell to third parties in the ad ecosystem like marketers’ ad agencies, as opposed to the marketers themselves. ,By contrast, many marketing tech companies have instead focused on selling software on a subscription basis, often directly to marketers. The recurring and relatively predictable software-as-a-service revenue model is often more attractive to investors because it’s less exposed to fluctuations in ad spending and other market dynamics.,“Software is just a better business,” said Jerry Neumann, an early-stage venture capitalist who has invested in advertising and marketing technology companies including Percolate, the Trade Desk and Yieldbot. “In ad tech you’re often an intermediary. Buyers use 20 different suppliers and test them all, which is why nobody could really get a foothold.”,The line between the two sectors is increasingly blurring. Even Pitchbook tracks a distinct, small third category of companies that straddle both advertising and marketing technology, which received $290 million in U.S. venture capital investment last year.,Ashu Garg, general partner at Silicon Valley-based venture-capital firm Foundation Capital, said he doesn’t think of ad tech and marketing tech as different industries. But the software-as-a-service model more typically associated with marketing tech is more attractive to investors, he said.,Mr. Garg said he typically looks for three things: the ability to create recurring revenue, direct relationships with customers, and evidence that companies can extract greater revenue from the same clients over time. It’s hard to tick all of those boxes with media-based business models, he said.,“I think we as investors are thinking much harder about which business models create long-term value,” Mr. Garg said. Foundation Capital has invested in companies including TubeMogul and AdRoll. ,Another consideration for early-stage investors is their potential exit. For many marketing and ad tech companies, the goal is to ultimately sell to a larger player.,Terry Kawaja, chief executive of LUMA Partners, which has offered strategic advice to numerous advertising and marketing-related technology companies, said there’s a wider pool of potential buyers for marketing technology companies than for advertising technology ones. That makes them more attractive to venture capitalists.,But it isn’t all bad news for ad tech. A stream of announcements this summer indicates that there’s still funding to be had, even if investors have become a little more discerning than they once were.,Among ad tech companies, Drawbridge raised $25 million in series C funding in May for its cross-device ad targeting and tracking company. In June, digital ad firm Collective raised $34 million in a round led by Columbia Partners, with Accel Partners, Greycroft and iNovi.,Earlier this month, ,.,Yieldbot CEO ,Jonathan Mendez, said this was the hardest time he has ever had raising money, largely because investors are asking tougher questions than they were four or five years ago. While Mr. Mendez said he secured the funding amount he had targeted, it took much longer than expected.,In recent years, many ad tech and marketing companies that raised money have struggled to grow in a highly competitive market dominated by large enterprise software companies and online ad giants such as Google and Facebook.,“There’s a lot of people who don’t believe any more, or have made bets that have lost in the past five years,” Mr. Mendez said. “That’s soured the market quite a bit.”,In contrast, Sprinklr CEO ,Ragy Thomas, described raising his company’s latest round as “fairly painless.” Sprinklr is a social media management software firm whose technology falls into the marketing tech category. The company raised , at a valuation of over $1.8 billion. ,Venky Ganesan, managing director at venture-capital firm Menlo Partners, said the distinction between “marketing tech” and “ad tech” is now almost meaningless. What matters more than the label is the underlying business model and technology. ,“I hardly meet anybody who says they’re ad tech anymore,” Mr. Ganesan said. “Ad tech has gone out of favor so everybody is rebranding themselves as martech. It’s old wine in a new bottle.”, ,Jack Marshall at , ,

The reality is it is much more involved, and this no doubt plays a significant part in the difficulty in recruitment.

Kimberly-Clark Scores Hit Video Series With ‘Carmilla’,Mike Shields,"This copy is for your personal, non-commercial use only. To order presentation-ready copies for distribution to your colleagues, clients or customers visit http://www.djreprints.com.,http://www.wsj.com/articles/kimberly-clark-scores-hit-video-series-with-carmilla-1472464800,With the summer coming to a close, , ,One teen-aimed series just wrapped up its season 3 shoot, and it’s being furiously edited in anticipation of a Sept. 15 premiere. When it comes to the look, feel and themes (love triangles and vampires), the show “,” isn’t far off from a drama on the CW or Freeform. ,However, unlike those cable networks’ top shows, “Carmilla” cranks out 36 (mini) episodes a year for YouTube. It’s also completely funded by an advertiser. ,Marketing giant Kimberly-Clark produces the show specifically to promote the young women-aimed feminine hygiene product U by Kotex. ,“Carmilla” is based on the vampire-focused novella written by ,in 1872 and could be mistaken for a scaled-down “True Blood” or “Vampire Diaries.” It’s one of the rare instances of a branded web series that not only resonates with fans, but actually had returned for multiple seasons and appears to be helping improve a marketer’s standing among those hard-to-reach millennial consumers.,The series was commissioned for , , by Shift2, a branded entertainment agency based in Toronto that specializes in helping marketers connect with millennials, and is produced by Smokebomb Entertainment, a production company that works frequently with Shift2.,Since it made its debut in 2014, 72 episodes have been released and most are about five minutes long. Overall, “Carmilla” has generated 43 million views on YouTube, even as the brand has done zero paid advertising to promote it. Jay Gottleib, president of adult and feminine care sector at Kimberly-Clark, said that episodes average about 150,000 unique viewers. ,Producing a full season of “Carmilla” costs $500,000 to $1 million, or roughly a quarter of an average episode of a cable TV show, estimated Jay Bennett, senior vice president of creative and innovation at Smokebomb.,Mr. Gottlieb acknowledged that producing “Carmilla” is still experimental for Kimberly-Clark, and it isn’t easy to prove its value—a common challenge for brands even as they spend more on original content. The company did commission the research firm Fresh Intelligence to survey 10,500 viewers in early 2015, which found that 31% claimed they bought U by Kotex because of the show and 93% knew that the brand was backing the series.,“It’s definitely increased purchase intent among viewers,” he said. “I can’t say this has directly lead to 20,000 new sales, but the best we can say is that it generated positive ROI. Share and volume continues to grow. This little bit is a part of it.”,The brand messaging is subtle. Many episodes don’t feature any mention of Kotex. In some cases, the product or labeling is seen in the background. In one episode, a character throws her ex-girlfriend’s Kotex tampons at her during a breakup argument.,“Fundamentally we didn’t approach this as a branded series,” said Mr. Bennett.,The show is set in modern times despite its 1800s origins and features actors talking to the screen, similar to many YouTube vloggers. Kimberly-Clark’s social media team tries to put out five promotional posts on various outlets for each episode. The show has found a vibrant audience on ,, particular among the LGBT community.,“We set about making a show for a particular audience, which allowed us to have the creative freedom to protect the storytelling from becoming a commercial,” Mr. Bennett said. “After all, you are probably trying to reach the most sophisticated audience in history.”, ,Mike Shields at , ,

Some publishers also use the information to display a counter on their website pages that shows the number of shares links to their articles, videos and other content receive across Facebook.,After being contact by The Wall Street Journal about publishers’ concerns, Facebook said the halted data was an unintended glitch, introduced as part of an update on Aug. 8 to “application programming interface” technology, through which Facebook shares data with third-party developers and publishers.,“We enacted a change that impacted the way a handful of third-party services deliver share count data to publishers. A fix is currently underway to ensure any affected developers can continue retrieving share count data as they had before,” a Facebook spokeswoman said in a statement.,Facebook didn’t specify when the problem would be resolved.,Many publishers and media companies now rely heavily on Facebook to distribute links to their content, and the glitch was a reminder of how much they rely on the social network for information about how it performs. Without data from Facebook, they have little insight into how their website content is being shared across the social network, and whether it is resonating with readers and viewers.,Some publishers have expressed concerns that Facebook will begin to limit the amount of data it shares with them about links back to their websites and instead provide more robust data only for content posted natively. That could potentially push media companies to publish more of their content directly to Facebook through initiatives such as Instant Articles.,Facebook recently stopped accepting new domains for a separate tool known as Domain Insights, for example, through which it shares information with publishers about traffic it sends back to their websites.,A Facebook spokesman said that even though it will not be accepting new sites for the Domain Insights tool, the company is looking at building out an alternative solution for publishers.,Rival social networking service , , faced criticism from some publishers and developers when it ,.,Twitter said it removed the feature for technical reasons and because it no longer wished to dedicate the resources necessary to support it., ,Jack Marshall at , ,

Omnicom will work with McDonald’s to build a new “agency of the future,” she said. “In selecting this agency, we will have access to top talent, technology and thinking with digital and data at the core.” ,The move brings all creative and media together within Omnicom, the holding company giant that owns DDB, the creative shop that has worked with McDonald’s for 45 years, and OMD, the restaurant chain’s media agency. ,It also makes it easier for the holding company to pool resources to create a dedicated unit—a trend as clients look for more cost-efficiency and consistency across traditional and digital advertising.,“This new model will, over the next few years, create great work at the speed of the marketplace at an efficient cost,” Ms. Wahl said in the statement. ,Publicis’ Leo Burnett and Omnicom’s DDB were the main incumbents. Both created teams with resources from multiple shops, according to people familiar with the matter. Publicis’ team included tech shop SapientNitro. ,McDonald’s spent $820 million on U.S. advertising in 2015, according to Kantar Media, which doesn’t count some forms of digital advertising.,McDonald’s joins the many marketers, including Harley-Davidson, Target and MetLife, that have cut ties with long-term agency partners in recent years.,Consultancy The Bedford Group issued a ,a few years ago showing that the decrease in relationship tenure between marketers and agencies didn’t happen overnight. According to the report, the average client-agency relationship tenure was 7.2 years as of 1984 but had declined to just 5.3 years by 1997. As of a few years ago, the average tenure was “thought to be less than three years.” ,While the McDonald’s decision is a big loss for incumbent Publicis, it’s good news for the creative team at DDB and DDB’s chairman emeritus ,, who was behind the famous “You Deserve a Break” tagline and catchy “Two-all-beef-patties-special-sauce-lettuce-cheese-pickles-onions, on a sesame seed bun” song.,Leo Burnett was behind the famous “Nothin but Net” ad in which Michael Jordan and Larry Bird compete for a Big Mac. ,Despite the agency change, the “I’m Lovin’ It” tagline will live on, McDonald’s said. ,McDonald’s has been trying to find a way to continue to ,after an initial bump from all-day breakfast offerings started to cool.

Firms Say Goodbye to Prettied-Up Financial Reports       ,Tatyana Shumsky,"This copy is for your personal, non-commercial use only. To order presentation-ready copies for distribution to your colleagues, clients or customers visit http://www.djreprints.com.,http://www.wsj.com/articles/companies-play-up-standard-accounting-figures-1472495965,More companies are giving investors the bad news first, in response to heavier regulatory scrutiny of their financial reporting.,More than a quarter of the companies in the S&P 500 index have shifted results that conform with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles to the top of news releases outlining their most recent financial performance. ,Among the S&P 500 companies reporting results since the start of July, 81% have given prominence to GAAP figures, an increase from the 52% that did so when reporting first-quarter results, according to an Audit Analytics analysis conducted for The Wall Street Journal.,Companies that have made the transition include , ,, , , and videogame maker , , ,The uptick comes in response to new guidance issued by the Securities and Exchange Commission in May that requires companies to give GAAP figures greater weight. It reflects concerns that adjusted or non-GAAP figures make companies look healthier. ,The SEC’s timing offered some breathing room, giving companies a chance to comply with the guidance for subsequent reporting periods, officials said.,The guidance, however, leaves little room for flexibility. If a paragraph or table contains standard and adjusted figures, companies must make sure sentences or columns with the standard, or GAAP, information precedes everything else. ,Numbers must be also be presented in the same style, meaning customized metrics can’t be bolded or printed in a larger-size font, nor can they be described as “record” or “exceptional” unless GAAP results are characterized in a similar way.,“There’s little appetite at the SEC for companies who don’t assess the guidance and self-correct,” said ,Paula Hamric,, a partner in accounting firm BDO USA’s national SEC practice. ,Halliburton highlighted $64 million in “income from continuing operations excluding special items” in its first-quarter press release. But when reconciled to standard accounting principles, the company had a loss of $2.4 billion. ,By contrast, the Houston oil-field services company led its second-quarter earnings release with a standard-accounting loss of $3.73 per share, or $3.2 billion.,A Halliburton spokeswoman confirmed that the change was made to comply with the SEC’s new instructions.,Over the past two quarters, drugstore operator Walgreens has switched around the sentences atop its earnings press release. The company led its fiscal second-quarter earnings release with an 11% increase in “adjusted net earnings,” adding that standard per-share results had plunged 56%. The following quarter, Walgreens put standard results first, reporting a 14% drop in per-share earnings.,“We did make some small changes to our most recent quarterly earnings announcement based on the new SEC guidance and to further enhance our disclosure to investors,” said a spokesman for Walgreens.,Some companies haven’t yet made the shift. Software provider , , said in its second-quarter earnings release in July that it hadn’t yet modified “adjusted net income” to reflect certain tax impacts—a change now required by the SEC. ,In a statement recently, Ellie Mae said it plans to comply with SEC guidelines and modify the “adjusted” benchmark, but is currently considering timing of the change. “Our measured approach to transitioning the reporting of this financial metric will balance our investors’ expectations with the concerns of the SEC staff,” the company said. ,Companies that don’t make the necessary changes run the risk of additional regulatory scrutiny in the form of letters and forced revisions. in letters made public through Aug. 5, the SEC questioned 166 companies this year regarding their use of non-GAAP figures, up 13% from a year earlier, according to Audit Analytics. ,The SEC makes such written exchanges public 20 days after the matter is resolved. The letters that have become public so far concern financial reports from before the new guidance was announced. ,Accountants expect such correspondence to surge as the SEC evaluates how companies handle the new requirement.,“It’s an evolutionary process,” said ,Jeffrey Jones,, a partner in KPMG’s SEC practice. “The preparer community, the audit community, the legal community as well as the SEC will be learning over the next couple of months where the lines are.”,Corporate chief financial officers may face a steep learning curve. The SEC’s new guidelines banned a number of metrics previously considered acceptable. Regulators said that adjusting results inconsistently or for recurring expenses could be misleading.,Complying with the new parameters is more challenging and time consuming than simply putting GAAP results at the front of the press release. CFOs must re-evaluate whether the numbers they have been reporting for years could be considered misleading in light of the new guidance. ,“You have investors and analysts that are used to seeing certain metrics, so in order to change the presentation, [CFOs] have to rethink what’s meaningful going forward,” said BDO USA’s Ms. Hamric.,In July, Electronic Arts Inc. became the first of three videogame makers to , information from its reporting to comply with the guidance. Rivals , , and , , followed suit.,“We’re trying to do exactly what we have been asked to do by the SEC, and we feel like we’re doing that in a very proactive way,” CFO ,Blake Jorgensen, said in advance of EA’s Aug. 2 earnings report, which said revenue rose 6% during the fiscal first quarter., , , which typically reports GAAP results first, made more nuanced changes. The company included more adjusted figures to show investors how the business would have fared without a recent acquisition. The goal was for investors to “make up their own minds about our performance,” said ,James Hoffmeister,, the company’s chief accounting officer.,“It’s not like we were afraid the SEC was going to come back and slap us on the wrist and tell us we were not doing a good job,” he said. “We looked at it as more of an opportunity.”,—Michael Rapoport contributed to this article. ,

After greenlighting recent flops like “Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles” and “Ben Hur,” , , Chief Executive Brad Grey was summoned to present a turnaround plan to parent company , ,’s newly expanded board. The pitch last week was said to include an explanation of the confluence of factors leading to a money-losing year and the relaunch of the studio’s animation and television-production capabilities. It seems to have worked, at least for now. ,, including Vice Chair Shari Redstone, reports The Wall Street Journal. It’s still probably not a bad idea for Mr. Grey to land a hit soon. Viacom will decide in the coming weeks whether to pursue the sale of a minority stake in Paramount. Meanwhile, the broader dispute over Sumner Redstone’s media empire is one step closer to conclusion after ,. , ,: Several years back, a handful of big media moguls spoke out about what they thought was an under-examined battle between news organizations and Google. Mark Cuban called Google a “vampire,” accusing the search engine of essentially stealing news organizations’ work. ,Rupert Murdoch, hinted that perhaps publishers should block their content from Google. Over time, the murmurs quieted down as more U.S. media companies came to realize they couldn’t live without search traffic. But things are different in Europe, which has adapted a much more pro-regulatory stance. , reports The Wall Street Journal. It seems like a risky battle. While it could help media companies negotiate lucrative fees, there’s also the risk that Google shuts off the traffic fire hose by refusing to pay or display a publisher’s content in its search results. As Matthew Jones, a partner at intellectual property law firm EIP, put it: “This could hurt the content owner much more than Google.”, ,: We’re just about two months away from Americans heading to the polls to pick a new president, and Republican candidate ,Donald Trump, (who’s never lacked free media attention) is finally spending money on TV ads. It’s awfully late in the game, considering that Mr. Trump is trailing in nearly every poll and has ,, reports Bloomberg. The states Mr. Trump is spending cash in provides insight into where the candidate’s advisers think this campaign will be won and lost, and so far he’s heavily targeting Florida, Pennsylvania, North Carolina and Ohio with broadcast TV ads.

The five-figure campaign, which is surely unprecedented in recent American politics, urges Mr. Trump to drop out of the race. , ,: Many marketers claim to be “publishers,” but outside of a few exceptions like Red Bull, most brands aren’t necessarily so good at creating content. (To be fair, not all media companies are always great at it either.) So, it’s noteworthy when a web series funded by an advertiser actually attracts an audience and even rarer when such a show comes back for another season. “Carmilla,” a show inspired by an 1800s vampire novella and , to promote the tampon brand U by Kotex, has generated over 40 million views on YouTube and it’s about to kick off its third season. While the show isn’t generating Emmy buzz just yet, it boasts of a rabid following on social media, helping Kimberly-Clark reach its target of young women who aren’t necessarily watching traditional TV in big numbers.

‘Charity’ Begins at Foggy Bottom,,"This copy is for your personal, non-commercial use only. To order presentation-ready copies for distribution to your colleagues, clients or customers visit http://www.djreprints.com.,http://www.wsj.com/articles/charity-begins-at-foggy-bottom-1472443638, , Welcome to “The Journal Editorial Report.” I’m Paul Gigot.,Hillary Clinton’s campaign is on the defense again as a new batch of emails released this week raises fresh questions about whether Clinton Foundation donors got preferential treatment from the State Department during her tenure there. This comes as an analysis by the Associated Press found 85 of the 154 people from private interests who met with Clinton in her first two years as secretary donated to the foundation, contributing $156 million to the charity.,Hillary Clinton called the AP report, quote, “a lot of smoke and no fire,” claiming they excluded nearly 2,000 meetings she had with world leaders.,And former President Bill Clinton chalked the latest controversy up to election year politics., , , , Joining the panel this week, Wall Street Journal Potomac Watch columnist Kim Strassel, associate editorial page editor James Freeman, editorial board member Dorothy Rabinowitz and Main Street columnist Bill McGurn.,Kim, what was the most important thing we learned this week, in your view, about the Clinton Foundation and the State Department and the relationship when she was secretary?, , I think the most important thing we learned is that they were essentially one and the same. That’s the importance of these emails that we got, from Huma Abedin, a Clinton aide. A bunch of her records were released this week, and it shows a constant back-and-forth discussion that she had with Doug Band, one of the executives at the Clinton Foundation, where they were in essence keeping track of schedules together and talking about the secretary’s events, and he was in many cases asking for special audiences in front of her with prominent Clinton Foundation donors. So despite her promise that she was distancing herself from the foundation, all of this was continuing while she was secretary of state., , What about this defense that some of her folks are offering, which is that she had—the AP report is wrong because it focuses on too narrow of a group of people who met with her and, in fact, she was meeting with thousands of more people. Does that wash?, , It doesn’t wash. Here’s the thing. Hillary Clinton was obliged as secretary of state to meet with foreign dignitaries and U.S. officials and those are the meetings she was talking about. She wasn’t obliged to meet with anybody outside of the State Department. That’s the 154 people that the AP report is talking about. And it’s notable, of the very few people she met from outside the State Department, the majority were Clinton Foundation donors., , So, Dorothy, do you see it this way?, ,Well, I think that the short answer is no, I don’t see it that way. The number of meetings she held was something like 1,700 meetings., , But most of them were with diplomats. That’s different than private interests, is it not?, , I don’t think that’s the case. Here’s the bottom line. With all of the talk, all of the revelations, there’s one truth that stands out: You cannot find a single case of proof that any tangible anything was given, any gifts were given, anything to the detriment of the United States., , There was no quo pro for the quid., , There is no pro. And all of the continuing smoke with no fire is only adding to itself. If you take that AP report, it starts off by saying, more than half of the meetings that she held—well, that’s quite an eye-catcher. More than half of the meetings—when you have 150 people that you met, 75 out of them—, , But if you’re a regular American and—you know, “I’d love to go talk to the secretary of state about my ideas, but I haven’t given $100 million to the Clinton Foundation”—are you getting that meeting? I don’t think you’re getting that meeting. James?, , Well, I think it’s a thing of value. Certainly there are companies, people every day in Washington paying a lot of money to arrange meetings with the cabinet secretaries. So I think the meeting itself is—, , Is of some value., , —is of value. One of our readers wrote in, out of Pennsylvania, saying: Why don’t these donations to the Clinton Foundation violate the Constitution, where people like Hillary Clinton, the State Department, are not supposed to be taking gifts from foreign powers?, , What about Dorothy’s point, though, that there really is no evidence so far that there was anything beyond meetings that they got in return, no policy shift—and certainly, with the crown prince of Bahrain, for example, who got a meeting after Doug Band intervened, but we don’t know that anything was done on his behalf., , I think arranging a meeting is a gift. But this is false, this claim that it was only meetings. We know, for example, one particular case where heavy Clinton Foundation donors ended up getting a favorable decision on the sale of large uranium supplies to Russia—to a Russian firm, I should say. Now, the claim by the Clintons is that the State Department under Hillary Clinton, Mrs. Clinton signed off on it, but she wasn’t very involved. That’s been coming in to question lately as more emails have come out., , There are quids and quos lying all over the floor here and we don’t know what they got in return. We don’t know what it’s based on. We don’t know what the private conversation was. We know after the crown prince, there was an arms deal for Bahrain. We don’t know—this goes back to the cattle futures when Tyson Foods—the lawyer there was advising Mrs. Clinton—, , When she was the first lady?, , When she was the first lady of Arkansas. And Tyson Foods got tax breaks. We don’t know whether that was in exchange but it looks messy.,Second, we know that the State Department, that agreement promised not just no quid pro quos but we’re going to separate this foundation, and now the State Department line is: Oh, we meant Mrs. Clinton, not her aides. We’re always parsing the word “is” or what it means by this with the Clintons., , You can see it doesn’t look good, Dorothy?, , Yes. I was about to say, yes, let’s use the phrase, the optics don’t look good. Let’s use another term. Let’s think about the charity itself which keeps getting buried in this discussion. That enterprise does enormous good, and no one disputes it, and it saves millions of lives from AIDS. This is a genuine charity., , James., , What the Clintons did was insert themselves as a middleman on a lot of charity going to the Third World. The idea that large foreign governments cannot get money to Africa without routing it through the Clinton Foundation in New York is just absurd., , OK. All right. Thank you very much. Fun discussion.,Still ahead, the Trump transformation continues. Is the GOP nominee backing off his call to deport 11 million illegal immigrants, and will the move expand his appeal or anger his core supporters?, , Donald Trump’s transformation continued this week with what the candidate himself suggested could be a softening on his signature issue, illegal immigration. Trump, who once called for a deportation force to remove 11 million undocumented immigrants, now says he’s willing to work with those who are law abiding., , , , , , , , Trump later told CNN that there would be no path to legalization unless they first left the country.,So, Bill, where is he finally coming out here, do we know?, , He’s coming very close to the old immigration reform that my former boss, George W. Bush, pushed in Congress. And—, , Which is what? How would you do it?, , I would say to try and correct the system and have a legal path for immigration and have some penalties for people that were here, that came here, but not deporting., , With enhanced border security., , And allow them to come here without citizenship. And the problem with this is Donald Trump is facing the reality. You can’t deport all these people, right? And some of them are law abiding. So he’s coming around to reality. The problem is, anyone else who did this before, the shouts were “RINO, RINO, RINO.” And anything short—, , “Amnesty, amnesty, amnesty.”, , That’s right. Anything short of deporting all of these people was called amnesty. Maybe now we’ll get a national conversation., , Dorothy?, , The problem with that is Donald Trump is not in the normal position of somebody finally discovering the truth. He’s in the position of saying, I have that base out there, I cannot do this. So he keeps wavering in this incredible way he’s done in the last 24 hours, because they are out there yelling, “Build the wall!” He says, I’m going to build the wall and they are going to be paying for the wall in Mexico. So how can he conceivably go forward with even this admission of reality? So he has to do these two things., , Kim, the economic realities are such that if he really did try to deport 11 million people in a couple of years, you probably couldn’t do it. It would cost a huge amount of money to hire the judges and the police to do it. And then you would also take all those workers out of the economy. That’s one reality. The other is politics. Do you think Donald Trump’s new advisers are telling him, “You know what, if you don’t move off your deportation position, you’re not going to win”?, , Yeah. Look, the reality is that there are some core Trump supporters for whom their No. 1 voting priority is deportation. No amnesty, deportation. But you’ve got to look at that. Even when you see polls that gauge Republican voters, the vast majority of Republican voters, that’s not necessarily their position on immigration. They want enhanced border security, as you said. They want some sort of situation in which maybe there’s a penalty, people pay a price for coming here illegally. But it’s not their top priority. That has to be balanced—those you might lose, that very small sliver of core Trump supporters, against the need for Mr. Trump to make progress with more-educated white voters, suburbanites and minorities, which is the coalition he’s going to have to do better among all of us, if he wants to have a chance of winning this election., , James, do you think that Trump is kind of moving to where it is a better position for him politically going into the election?, , Yeah, absolutely. I know it looks a little messy as he makes the evolution, but basically what he’s getting to is, I think, where most people are—certainly most Republicans. If he wants to tie up that suburban vote, which is we don’t want political correctness allowing terrorists in the country, we want a screening for that. We want a culture of law. We don’t want criminals to be allowed to be here. But we recognize hard-working people, who are making a contribution, should stay, and we want them here, and their values. It kind of gets lost, all of this negative stuff about immigration. Half of the billion-dollar startups in the country were founded by immigrants. We need immigrants., , Go ahead, Dorothy., , All of this sounds very rational in a rational world of political figures, of which Donald Trump is no member. I mean, here is somebody who cannot be with one position for more than two days. And he has behind him the element of this group to whom he is completely beholden. He does not want to lose them. You cannot say these are normal strategies. Here’s someone that came to power because “I’m not your normal politician.”, , Where are they going to go? They are not going to Hillary Clinton. And I think now he makes it very tough for Never Trumpers in the Republican Party to have a case, because you go issue after issue, he’s now better than Hillary Clinton., , I also think, look, the guy is moving closer to our position on this. And I think he should be applauded when he moves in the right direction. I mean, would we rather that he stuck with this position that was untenable and really hurt the Republican future?, , Kim, what’s fascinating to me is to watch the reaction of the Clinton campaign. They, I think—as soon as he jumped back on the CNN position to say, look, they may have to be deported after all, they said, see, there he is again, this is the real Trump. I think they want him to stay with the most extreme immigration position because they think that’s better politics for them. They are afraid if he moves to the middle on immigration, somehow, they won’t be able to define him as extreme., , They need him to be there. The reality is, in most big policy areas, whether it’s economics or this or anything, energy, Donald Trump has a better position than they do, so they don’t want to talk about positions., , Thanks, Kim.,When we come back, Donald Trump running strong with evangelical voters? But is their support for the Republican or a vote against Hillary Clinton? Will they turn out in November? We’ll ask Ralph Reed, next., , , , That was Donald Trump last month accepting the Republican nomination for president and thanking evangelical voters for their support. A poll taken earlier this summer by the Pew Research Center found more than three-quarters of white evangelicals plan to vote for Trump, but the results also suggest that they may be motivated more by their dislike for Hillary Clinton than their enthusiasm for the Republican nominee.,Ralph Reed is the chairman of the Faith and Freedom Coalition. He is joining me from Atlanta.,Welcome, Ralph. Good to have you here., , Thanks, Paul. Good to be with you., , So you know that since Ronald Reagan, evangelical voters have been a core part of the Republican coalition. How is Donald Trump doing with those voters compared to previous Republican nominees?, , I think he’s hitting at the industry standard if not heading to really the highest we’ve ever seen. If you look at the average of the four polls that we’ve had—you mentioned the Pew poll; there have been three others since then that we consider to have reliable evangelical data. If you take the average of those, it’s about 73% right now for Donald Trump and about 18% for Hillary Clinton.,This is critical, Paul, because it’s the largest single constituency in the electorate. It’s between 24% and 27% of the electorate. If you add frequently Mass-attending Catholics, it’s another 9% or 10%. It’s bigger than the Hispanic vote, bigger the African-American vote, and bigger than the feminist and gay vote combined., , Right., , The highest ever recorded for a presidential nominee was George H.W. Bush’s 82% in 1988. Seventy-eight percent was recorded by George W. Bush in 2004, and matched by Mitt Romney., , All right. So Donald Trump—not a socially conservative lifestyle, I think it’s fair to say, traditionally. So what is resonating with those voters? What issue is he hitting that really counts in this election?, , I think one thing that he’s done, Paul, that is important, and it’s sort of obvious but it gets missed a lot, is he has actually shown up to their audiences and asked for the vote. So that matters. You know, the presence, the physical presence of the candidate, a rhetorical appeal, an argument rhetorically that I share your values, and I desire to see your role in society enhanced.,And I would say beyond that, his fealty to their positions on the sanctity of life, on traditional marriage, on support for the state of Israel, on religious freedom, particularly, that progeny of cases before the Supreme Court, like ,and ,and, finally, his full-throated opposition to the Iran nuclear deal, which I think resonates powerfully in this community because they consider Iran to be an existential threat to the survival of the state of Israel., , It’s interesting, Ralph, when I listen to Donald Trump, two of the main issues he’s stressing are immigration and trade. He doesn’t really stress the social issues. That’s true, speaking to some of the audiences that you’re talking about, he does mention those. But on a day-to-day basis, it’s trade and immigration that he really hits hard. Are those issues that resonate with evangelicals, or is it something that they take for granted and go back to their core issues?, , I think among some, it does. To the extent that it fits in to a broader tapestry of him saying that he’s going to put America first, he’s going to defend American interests, I think that resonates. But I think if you look at the polling, Paul, not just among voters of faith, but among all voters, those two issues, trade and immigration, actually rank pretty low—, , Right., ,—on the hierarchy of voter concern., , That’s my point., , What’s driving—yeah, what’s driving this election predominantly, even among voters of faith, is the economy, this jobless anemic recovery, a forward-leaning national-security posture that helps us combat and defeat Islamic terrorism, and then you start to get in to health care and some others. But that’s the cluster of issues that people are voting on., , So I look at the polls in the battleground states and some of the states that were won comfortably by Republicans in the past, Georgia, for example; Missouri, where evangelical voters are a strong part of the population. And yet, the election—, , Right., , —the election right now is a lot closer than you would expect, with Hillary Clinton actually competitive. Why?, , I think in the—I can speak most intelligently about Georgia, but I think this applies to a lot of states. Georgia has a large African- American vote. It’s going to be, I think, 30% of the vote., , Right., , And I think you take that and the Democrats’ share of the white vote, and it’s going to be competitive. And this is not news. I mean, John McCain barely beat Obama here because of that surge of African- American votes. But, look, the bottom line is, and this is not exactly a news flash, Donald Trump has had a rough few weeks., , Right., , And a sinking tide has lowered all boats. So it’s made the ballot test a lot closer in places like Texas and Utah and Missouri and Georgia that it shouldn’t be. My sense is that they have turned that corner. And I think the polling is going to be a lot better for him, not only in those red states, but nationally and in the battleground states., , The last time you came up to see us, you said this was a pick-’em race, 50/50. Do you still stand by that, despite the polling?, , I think if Donald Trump stays on message and fixes some of the candidate performance issues that he needed to deal with coming out of Cleveland, I think this is an extremely competitive race.,And I will say this, Paul, but I’m not in the prediction business, but based on what we’re seeing anecdotally, these voters of faith are going to turn out, and they are going to turn out in huge numbers, and I think he’s going to get north of 75% of that vote, and if that is baked into the cake—, , Right., ,—there is no way that she runs away with this election. I think it will be competitive., , All right. Thanks, Ralph Reed. Good to see you. Thanks for coming in., , Good to see you, Paul., , Still ahead, charges of racism from both campaigns this week as Donald Trump continues his outreach to minority voters. A look at Trump’s attack and Clinton’s response when we come back., , , , Donald Trump, in Jackson, Miss., this week, ratcheting up his criticism of Hillary Clinton as he continues to court minority voters.,Clinton responded to Trump’s attacks in a speech in Reno Thursday, linking the Republican nominee to the so-called alt-right movement and accusing him of taking hate mainstream., , , , We’re back with Kim Strassel, Bill McGurn and Dorothy Rabinowitz. And Wall Street Journal editorial board member Joe Rago also joins the panel.,Kim, what do you think of the strategy here by Trump, both to go after minority voters in an overt, explicit way and then the way he’s doing it?, ,He does need to do this. One thing that is noticeable is he kept that up over a week. He didn’t just give one speech and be done with it, which is a problem that some Republican candidates do at times. The way he’s doing it is, look, he’s talking about policies that he wants to offer that he thinks will help minorities in the country., , Right., , His criticism of Hillary Clinton is something that reminds me of George W. Bush, the soft bigotry of low expectations, which he used in an education context. But the argument is that the Democrat Party is very low on solutions for things that are the biggest problems in a lot of inner city and minority communities. So I mean, I think it’s a strong way of going about it if he can stay on message., , Dorothy, Mitt Romney only got 6% of the African-American vote. It’s hard to do worse than that. Barack Obama isn’t at the top of the Democratic ticket. It makes sense to me to try to appeal to those voters., ,It will do worse than that. Yes, it makes sense if Donald Trump were another kind of candidate who could actually reach out. He does not go before black audiences. He says to them, you live in hell., , You mean he’s been making this pitch in front of—, , He’s been a pitch—, ,—largely white audiences in suburbs and—, , That’s right. And the portrait of black American is the same portrait that lives in the hearts of many of his white supremacist followers, which believe he doesn’t characterize all of Mr. Trump’s followers, by any means. The point is, they are low down, they live in hell. Where is the black middle class that lives—,(CROSSTALK), , You mean he should be addressing them?, , Yes. But it’s more than that. It’s a false portrait of black America and the condescension, unfortunately, in his address to them is powerful., ,That argument, I think, is holding Trump to a double standard. We’ve heard the Black Lives Matter movement for more than a year that things are going terribly in black America. Trump, I agree, is clumsy, but you could hardly say, well, if he criticizes the conditions in minority communities that that’s any different than anything else., , Yeah, the people on the left have been telling us that we have to throw money at inner cities because, somehow, their lives are desperate, and now when Trump says, look, I have alternative solutions, we say, “Oh, boy, that’s not fair”?, ,Yeah. Look, I think Trump has a good message and I think “So what have you got to lose?” is a great message for Republicans. They should have been making it earlier. He should show some guts, go to a charter school. But it’s a good argument. ,Look, Joel Kotkin had a study of the African-American middle class and the cities where they did better. They were all in the red states and former Confederate states., , Where I think I agree with you, Dorothy, is when Trump uses that word “bigot” against Hillary Clinton. I don’t think that anybody believes that. It personalizes things in a way. That if he—his argument would resonate more if he kept on the issues, like educational opportunity, jobs and so on., , But he doesn’t raise those issues. He says, quote, “Hillary’s program are detrimental to blacks.” What programs is he talking about? There are no specifics. It’s simply an amount of name calling., , All right. Thank you.,Let’s talk about this alt-right argument that Hillary Clinton is making, Trump is bringing this group of voters into the mainstream. First of all, what is the alt-right, Joe?, , It’s a term of grievance politics and identity politics opposed to multiculturalism, pluralism, globalism, and it has always been—, , From the right?, , From the right. It’s always been a tendency within—, , The right. The right., ,—conservatism and very broadly defined. I mean, going back to the paleoconservatives, Pat Buchanan. The difference of the alt-right now is that they’ve gone digital. They’ve moved to 4chan and Redditt and so forth. It’s a form of seeking out—, , But how strong is it?, , It’s not strong at all. Hillary Clinton called it a fringe movement in her speech this weekend. And saying Trump is taking it mainstream, I think, gives it too much credit., , Look, to the Democratic Party, the Republican Party is one big hate group. And it didn’t start with Donald Trump. We have Joe Biden the last time around saying that Romney is going to put you all in chains to a group of African-Americans, a largely African-American audience. They always treat this—it’s smart for Hillary politically for two reasons. One, it gets us off the subject of these emails and, two, it plays to the concerns that people have about Donald Trump., , All right. Thank you all.,Still ahead, the NAACP votes for a moratorium on charter schools despite growing support in many black communities for education alternatives. So what’s behind the split?, , At its annual convention in Cincinnati, members of the NAACP voted to approve a resolution calling for a moratorium on the expansion of charter schools, despite recent polling that shows black Americans support alternatives to traditional public schools, and charters in particular.,Shavar Jeffries is a civil rights attorney and president of Democrats for Education Reform.,Welcome., ,Thank you. Thanks for having me., , Explain to me why the NAACP would take this position. It’s supposed to be for advancement of minorities, all right?, , That’s right., , And charter schools are, a lot of the evidence shows, helping the advancement of—, , Absolutely., , —of Americans., , The evidence shows strongly that the best-performing public charter schools in our country have changed the lives of young people, particularly young people of color. We’re very disappointed with the NAACP’s take there. The NAACP has an historic legacy of helping people of color—, , Sure., , —and we just think was a departure from that and—, , How do you explain it?, , Well, when you look at the history of the NAACP, they were really birthed during the Jim Crow desegregation era. And post-, there were efforts to circumvent desegregation through choice mechanisms. Some states even closed their public schools and created vouchers for families to get around these decrees. So NAACP kind of comes from that history. And charters are birthed in a very different of history. And it’s also the case that the NAACP is a larger middle-class organization, a large number of folks who work in the public-sector unions, and so I think there is a kind of intellectual resistance to public charter schools from that standpoint. So we do a lot of work giving them data showing that these schools are really doing great things for you people of color and we need their support., , So you think it’s ideological, to some extent, saying these are alternatives to traditional public schools and, therefore, we can’t support them because—or maybe is it because the unions are providing financial support to the NAACP?, , I think there’s a piece of it that’s union support. But I also think it’s more intellectual and policy based. I wouldn’t want to disrespect the NAACP and say it’s transactional. But a large number of the members—the economics of many black communities are rooted in public-sector opportunities and so some perceive the public charters as disrupting that in a way that makes it difficult for black and brown folks to succeed economically. So I think all of that is in the mix., , You and I live in New York., , Yes, sir., , And we know that you go to Success Academy—, , That’s right., , —you go up to Harlem and to the charter schools around the city that are predominantly minority—, , Absolutely., , —Hispanic and African-American, and they are doing phenomenally well., , Yes., , Not in every case but, by and large, the evidence and the Credo study that Stanford did—, , Absolutely., ,—shows that it’s getting great results, generally speaking, for charter kids. Why is it so hard to sell that message of the results?, , Well, we need more leaders who are respected by black and brown folks to propagate this. The families support this. I think it’s very important to be clear. So while there are a handful of organizations that express opposition to public charter schools, hundreds of thousands of black and brown families are choosing charter schools and are fighting to protect them. So we still have more work to do at the leadership level but we’re going to win this fight over history because this is right., , Well, you know about the demonstrations here., , Sure., , On behalf are charters. It’s full of—I mean, thousands of African-American parents out there saying give our kids the same choice that the affluent Americans have—, , That’s right. That’s right., ,—and the president of the United States, for example, had., , Absolutely. True., , It’s fascinating to me that you’ve seen a regression, despite all of that, among some Democratic Party leaders. Barack Obama is for charters., , Yes, he is., , Bill Clinton has been for charters., , Absolutely., , Yet, if you look at this election campaign, Secretary Clinton has backtracked from what her husband’s position was. She’s now expressing some wariness towards charters., , Well, and she’s also—on multiple occasions, including before some of the teacher unions, expressed support for public charters as well., , Right., , She catalyzed public charters as first lady of Arkansas, first lady of the United States. She’s been for education reform for 40 years, working on the Children’s Defense Fund, jump-starting the Children’s Health Insurance Program. Now beyond Secretary Clinton, who has expressed support for charters, there’s no question that there was substantial influence. And fighting for workers is something that we support, but we have to fight for children, and we have to support the things that work, and the things that don’t work we have to be able to change. So charters throughout this country are changing the lives of young people of color, particularly black and brown families. And I’m very confident, as we continue to press that case, over time, the Democratic Party is true to its values and fight for kids., , There was a case this week in California, the , decision, where they wanted to lower state-level—minority plaintiffs said you are denying the right to equal education because of the poor performance of traditional schools, and yet the state Democratic establishment supported the unions against their case. And, of course, now they have lost in state court., , Yes., , How do you—why so much opposition?, , Again, the teachers unions are a political force. They fought for workers, for educators. And we love our educators. We’ve fought for them for 40 years. They have significant political power within the Democratic Party. We’ve found opportunities to work with them in a whole variety—particularly teacher prep. Because while they’re focused on underperforming teachers, and we have to work with that, we also have to create better incentives to get different people into the class in the first place. But what’s going to happen over the next generation—we have to build on President Obama’s legacy within the party of fighting for change for kids, and we have to organize and mobilize parents and fans and communities to sustain the policies that work for kids., , Shavar Jeffries, thank you so much for coming in., , Thank you., , A very important debate inside the Democratic Party. Thank you., , Thank you., , When we come back, the EpiPen outrage. Hillary Clinton joins the chorus of politicians demanding action over the skyrocketing cost of the life-saving device. But what is really behind the price spike? Find out after the break., , A growing controversy over a life-saving treatment for millions of Americans with severe allergies. The drug maker Mylan is under fire for the skyrocketing price of the EpiPen, which now costs families more than $500 for a pack of two, up from about $100 from 2008. Members of Congress are promising an investigation. And Hillary Clinton on Wednesday demanded that Mylan reduce the price of the pens, calling the increase outrageous and the latest troubling example of a company taking advantage of its consumers.,We’re back with Joe Rago, James Freeman and Bill McGurn.,Joe, usually when you get big price hikes in drugs or expensive drugs, it’s because there’s an innovation, something new, some on patent. The EpiPen has been off patent for years. What’s going on?, , Well, Mylan is pursing a strategy of increasing the price by 10% or 15% every quarter. They’ve done this since 2008. The reason they are able to do so is because they have a monopoly. Nobody else can get into the market. You’ve had a string of competitors over the years trying to create a generic EpiPen, and they’ve been blocked by the FDA, by the Food and Drug Administration., , Why? This is not a super-complicated technology., , No. It’s a basic engineering challenge. What the FDA has—they essentially have regulatory anxiety about allowing new products on to the market. Companies have to prove that their competitor is the same as the EpiPen. It’s hard to do with these kinds of—, , The same? Even if it does 85% of the job or 95% of the job?, , Right. And the truth is the EpiPen fails all the time. It’s not the gold standard of delivering doses of adrenaline. So this is completely a regulatory artifact and not what would be happening in a competitive market., , How many competitors have been blocked by the FDA?, , You had one competitor who introduced a competitor EpiPen. They had to withdraw it after 26 misdiagnoses. That was probably due to the FDA. And then you’ve got two companies right now trying to get their product onto the market and the FDA is demanding more tests and data., , I guess the argument would be, Bill, that if you—never mind that, true, and I think that’s irrefutable what Joe said—still, it’s immoral for the company to increase the price., , They can’t do it without competition. We have to get back to the essential truth. The opposite of competition is not cooperation, like the FDA—it’s collusion. That’s what we’re seeing. Congress doesn’t lower prices. Competition does.,And what Joe is saying, what the FDA does is it kind of takes this model of the EpiPen and—it struggles when people go outside the box of the model. I’ll put it like the taxi and limousine service that can’t quite process an Uber. And the costs of coming in are so high that it discourages people that might have a different idea., , But the question, the Democrats are saying unconscionable that you would raise prices. Even though you have a government-protected monopoly, it’s still unconscionable. Let’s face it, do we really need to charge 500 bucks for these things, James?, , We were talking about regulatory anxiety. There’s a treatment for this. It’s free markets. We don’t have to rely on the CEO to be a very nice person or not. Competition is the discipline.,People talk—people who like Hillary Clinton talk about how she’s a policy wonk. She gets to the back of every briefing book. This shows she has not studied this issue at all. We’ve been through this—Valiant pharmaceuticals, Turing. This is just the latest. Price goes up on an old drug, off-patent, politicians scream, and then we learn that the FDA has been keeping all the competitors out of the market. So she needs to study this industry. She’s also, by the way, learned nothing from the failure of her ’93 health-care plan—the same ideological approach, instead of looking at the facts., , Why isn’t it unconscionable for government? The answer is this is a government-created problem, and we’ll end in more government for it. Why is it never the government that is unconscionable by restricting this market?, , The problem is that companies like Mylan are violating kind of the bargain that consumers are willing to finance innovation. I think the dangers of the drug companies are going to get Hillary Clinton’s drug price controls., , All right, Joe. Thank you all.,We’ll have to take one more break. When we come back, “Hits and Misses” of the week., , Time now for our “Hits and Misses” of the weekend. Kim, start us off., , Paul, this is a hit to France’s top administrative court for overturning burkini bans that were popping up in French coastal towns. You know, it isn’t just that these bans violated constitutional rights and targeted people solely for their religious convictions. I mean, you could go to the beach in a full wet body suit to go surfing, and that was fine, but not if you were there for religious convictions. But it’s also good because it essentially holds up France’s right to not tell women what they are supposed to wear., , All right, thanks, Kim. William?, , Paul, this is a miss to Jonathan Perry, a Republican state senator in Louisiana, who is proposing to regulate the “Cajun Navy.” The Cajun Navy is the unofficial nickname for the citizens that just take their flat-bottomed boats and go out to rescue other people. The Cajun Navy is very sophisticated. They are using Facebook and phone apps to pinpoint people and help to deliver it. These are people that are taking the initiative. The last thing they need is regulation., , All right. Joe?, , A hit for one to the rare colleges willing to stand up for free inquiry. That’s the University of Chicago. In a letter this week, the dean of students told the incoming freshmen to prepare to be challenged and even discomforted by their education. He wrote: “Our commitment to academic freedom means we do not support so-called trigger warnings. We do not condone the creation of intellectual safe spaces where individuals can retreat from perspectives that are different from their own.” Congratulations for treating students like the adults they are., , James? , , Paul, more good news from campus, believe it or not. There’s been a sighting of an honest liberal. At Harvard University, law professor Laurence Tribe studied the D.C. Circuit opinion and said, yes, the IRS did target conservatives. By the way, there’s a great book on this called “The Intimidation Game” that you might want to check out., , Who’s the author of that, James?, , Uh, uh., , Kim Strassel., , Thank you, James., , All right, thank you all. And it is a good book.,That’s it for this week’s show. Thanks to my panel and to all of you for watching. I’ll Paul Gigot. We hope to see you right here next week.,

Greece’s Chicest New (and Very Old) Beach Destination ,,"This copy is for your personal, non-commercial use only. To order presentation-ready copies for distribution to your colleagues, clients or customers visit http://www.djreprints.com.,http://www.wsj.com/articles/greeces-chicest-new-and-very-old-beach-destination-1472063834,The second we landed, the passengers on my flight from New York to Athens were so anxious to exit the plane that someone’s fedora popped off in the crush and got flattened like a Frisbee. “They’re all racing to the islands,” the flight attendant told me, and when I sauntered into the airport I could see the itchy mob running for their connecting flights to Santorini and Mykonos, Paxos and Naxos. I was taking my time, though, because I was headed to the Peloponnese peninsula, the mainland outlier that too many travelers skip for the lure of those islands. ,Some might want to reconsider. Dangling like a giant maple leaf off the Corinthian Isthmus, just south of Athens, the 8,000-plus square mile Peloponnese might look like a behemoth, too big to tackle. But a recent constellation of seaside resorts has helped rebrand the peninsula as one of Greece’s glossiest beach destinations. And then it offers its own unique attractions, including major archaeological sites and historic villages. , , Buses do run from Athens International Airport to the Peloponnesian Peninsula but the 186-mile route to Monemvasia can take up to nine hours. The better option, especially if you want to explore the region, is to pick up a rental car at the airport. Monemvasia is about a four-hour drive from the Athens airport., , Several recently unveiled hotels have helped turn the Peloponnesian Peninsula into a stylish resort destination. The , development on the peninsula’s western coast features two golf courses, a beach overlooking the Ionian Sea and a pair of hotels: The Westin Resort , and the more upscale The Romanos ,. Honeymooners opting for a big splurge on the Aegean coast should head to Amanzo’e (part of the , brand). A seamless expanse of neoclassical columns and marble, the sprawling property offers stand-alone guest pavilions, a spa, a library stocked with real books and an Instagram-worthy beach , For a model of elegant restoration, the Kinsterna Hotel 4 miles outside Monemvasia, lets you bed down in a Byzantine-era estate framed by olive groves ,. The best budget option, though, situated in the old town of Monemvasia itself, is the Byzantino hotel (, , , Each of the peninsula’s standout hotels offers its own take on locally sourced, updated Greek food. Among the Costa Navarino’s 12 and counting restaurants, Armyra does right by the freshest daily catch ,. Amanzo’e’s airy dining room dishes up a delicate zucchini tart, as well as a whopping sea bass baked in salt ,, while the Kinsterna is famous for its fish soup and a playfully tweaked moussaka ,. For a photogenic lunch in Monemvasia, the Emvasis Café serves a brimming bowl of fresh regional fruit on a terrace perched above the sea ,.,Much of the peninsula is also newly accessible, courtesy of a recently constructed EU-funded toll road that cuts through the heart of the Peloponnese. Soon after picking up my airport rental car I was driving past olive groves, cypress trees and high craggy mountains. If the scenery was myth-worthy so were the passing place names, including exits to the archaeological sites of Mycenae, Argos and Olympia (the site of the original Olympic Games). But I resisted stopping and kept plowing southwest until I reached Messene three hours later. Like so many classical capitals, Messene sits in a commanding spot, overlooking a wide open plain and surrounded by a wreath of mountains. Upon arrival, I joined one of the occasional tours that Petros Themelis, director of the excavation, leads around the site. “In the 4th century B.C., this was one of the largest cities in ancient Greece,” he said. “The Messenians fought with the Athenians against their Spartan neighbors, and the city was really built as a fortress.” We walked down the long agora, the ancient marketplace. Just beyond we passed a sacrificial altar and then an amphitheater that echoed the slope of the surrounding mountains. At the city’s edge lay a horseshoe-shape stadium and gymnasium rimmed by high Doric columns. The city’s young men trained here, bulking up to stay as fit as their Spartan enemies, who prepared for battle from birth.,I decided, after the long day, to give equal time to those enemies and stop for the night in Sparta, 55 miles east. The modern city, a huddle of unadorned concrete buildings that give new meaning to the word “spartan,” is mostly a pit stop now. Yet anyone stopping in the Peloponnese for a longer stay has fresher options. Two hours west of Sparta sits the mammoth new Costa Navarino development, which includes a pair of resorts and golf courses overlooking the Ionian Sea. To the northeast on the Aegean coast is Amanzo’e, a gleaming marble splurge of a resort designed as a 21st-century acropolis. But I was determined to reach the peninsula’s southeastern tip, so the following morning I got back on the road. Driving down from Sparta, bumping onto narrow, winding roads that seemed to wander aimlessly, free of all that EU-funded formality. This was deep-country Greece; it was easy enough to picture Zeus tossing off lightning bolts from its jagged mountain tops. The olive groves stretched to the horizon and the villagers, indifferent to tourists, weren’t selling anything beyond the fringe of oranges that hung from the roadside fruit stalls. If foreigners, or even Greeks, know this wild part of the peninsula at all, it is for two attractions. The first is the peninsula’s southernmost Mani region, where the towns are stippled by high watchtowers, the oldest dating back to the 15th century, designed as a protection against neighboring clans. But even those spectral villages, where the Mani women still sing improvised dirges in the houses of the dead just as they did in ancient times, weren’t as haunting as the second destination, Monemvasia, my last stop.,On the eastern border of the Mani, Monemvasia is a village on a rocky islet that hangs by a ribbon of causeway off the peninsula’s southern coast. Its name translates, roughly, as “single entrance,” and I could see why when I parked my wheezing car outside of the pedestrian-only town. The village of Monemvasia is hidden from view from the road, obscured by the islet’s craggy face; the only way to reach it is through a long, dark tunnel that looked slightly sinister, though I emerged onto a village street that could have passed for a “Mamma Mia!” set. A largely Byzantine settlement variously inhabited by just about everyone sailing past—from the Franks to the Venetians and Ottomans—Monemvasia crawls up the rock in layers of stone houses. I walked its cobbled lanes, each bend revealing its own tableau: a marble archway framing the sea; terra-cotta roofs sprouting wildflowers; staircases winding up. The higher I hiked, the harder it was to tell those stony houses from the outcrop itself.,Ultimately I came down panting to the village’s version of a main street, where the shops were selling souvenir detritus (plastic worry beads; fridge magnets of Athena, reduced to the goddess of kitchen appliances). I settled for some olive oil soap and then drove on to Kinsterna Hotel, just south of town, my first sustained stop after the long manic drive from Athens, and worth the wait. A zealously renovated Byzantine estate, Kinsterna is a classic stone manor house, banked by orange orchards, olive groves and vineyards. Terraces, one punctuated by a swimming pool, drop down in tiers toward the sea. “The original estate lay in ruins when we started the long renovation in 2006,” ,Christos Koutsopoulos,, the hotel’s manager, told me. If the property is a study in cultural preservation, so is chef ,George Hapsas,’ food. “Eighty percent of the produce we use is grown on the estate, and our daily catch comes from local fisherman,” Mr. Hapsas said, as he served me lunch on the long terrace. My grilled octopus nuzzled thumb-size fava beans; an amberjack souvlaki spit juice. Before a dessert of yogurt mousse, Mr. Hapsas wanted to show me something. “Come,” he said, leading me to a plot of land and pointing to three monumental eucalyptus trees in a row. “These are special,” he said, drumming a hand on one massive tree trunk. “Each one is 500 years old.” He looked expectantly at me, waiting for a response. But, after my drive down the peninsula, where everything claims its own ancient pedigree, I probably didn’t look at all surprised.,

Yet these kinds of glitches seem rather routine for a company known for its engineering prowess. And in this case, some publishers were in the dark about how well their content was performing on Facebook, which isn’t a good place to be in 2016.

Could that network serve as a case study of the demographic challenges many cable programmers face? , by The Atlantic. Fox News’ immediate problem is the scandal surrounding the exit of ,Roger Ailes,, of course, but its longer-term issue is that its audience is limited to mostly older white men. Half the network’s audience is 68 or older, , reports Bloomberg. The thorny question is, will these viewers be fully replaced over time by younger viewers (younger, as in people in their 50s)? If not, how does Fox News evolve? , ,: It can’t be too much fun for Google’s YouTube to hear about all these wild daily streaming boasts from Snapchat and Facebook--and especially all the hype about Facebook Live.

YouTube’s head of product Neal Mohan told the Financial Times ,. “When consumers think about video, whether that’s on-demand or live, they think of YouTube. Live is one part of the picture,” he said. That’s true. But when people think of live streaming using their mobile devices, they probably think of Facebook or Periscope. So YouTube needs to work to make its mobile app a default venue for this behavior. Or, it can focus on premium events--the FT reports that YouTube drew 2.2 million viewers for the recent live stream of the UEFA Champions League final.,Fox News is going on the offensive against former on-air personality Andrea Tantaros, who alleged she was removed from a Fox News show after rebuffing the advances of Roger Ailes. In a court filing the network called Ms.Tantaros an “opportunist” and said she violated a network policy by publishing a book without permission. [,],The Mondelez brand may live on after all.

And this past Friday night, ,tried its hand at a live sketch comedy show akin to “Saturday Night Live.” The show aired live on YouTube for more than an hour and 20 minutes, complete with old-fashioned sponsor mentions and commercial breaks., ,, which was filmed live in a YouTube production studio in Los Angeles at 5 p.m. PST on Friday, peaked at nearly 58,000 concurrent viewers, said ,Keith Richman,, president of the digital media company Defy Media, which operates Smosh. As of Tuesday afternoon, the show, which featured a mix of sketches and mock TV commercials, had eclipsed 1.3 million views on YouTube, while generating close to 200,000 comments. After the live stream, the show was made available on demand on the Google-owned video platform. ,The live-stream event marked one of the more ambitious experiments by web-born media talent, and it’s noteworthy that it was on YouTube, not Facebook Live. Mr. Richman said that decision made sense because Smosh was born on YouTube, where it has more than 22 million subscribers and its videos consistently rack up millions of views. ,Mr. Richman acknowledged that Defy is exploring similar ventures on Facebook and other platforms. ,.,Mr. Richman said that Defy is encouraged by the time spent by most viewers, considering the timing on a Friday night “when many of our fans are out.” So far, the show has generated over 250,000 hours of viewing time, and average viewing sessions during the live show were north of 15 minutes.,But beyond the numbers, the overall goal of the broadcast was twofold, he said. The point was to help Smosh learn what works in the live medium and to showcase that Smosh’s quality is on par with TV.,“We think Smosh represents the ‘SNL’ of the internet,” he said. “And we wanted to do an ‘SNL’-type show, and we really wanted to elevate live.” Most of what has been done to date by digital creators and media companies has been “personalities talking to a camera, or just content that’s poorly done.”,The live show was designed to demonstrate that digital content is just as legitimate as the traditional television industry. The Smosh feature-length movie was also part of proving their abilities, and there’s another movie in the works. ,“Just because we are digital doesn’t mean the audience isn’t there or the quality isn’t premium,” Mr. Richman said.,The brand 5 Gum signed on to sponsor the live show. Smosh produced two original video ads for the brand, which were inserted into the live stream during breaks, which allowed for the sets to be rearranged. Terms of the ad deal weren’t disclosed., ,Mike Shields at , ,

And the bust’s material, white marble, syncs with the coffee table’s top. “The room would come across as being of someone who’s very traveled.”...

Can teens be helped to assess risk more accurately? ,—G.M.,A:Several factors can serve as a brake on risk-taking. Teens who feel obligated to family members—to spend time with them, help with household tasks and care for siblings—take fewer risks in laboratory experiments and show a reduced physiological response to potential rewards, according to ,of 48 adolescents. Close family ties may make teens reluctant to anger or embarrass loved ones. Also, doing chores affords opportunities to practice self-control.,Teens who have good decision-making skills are less likely to take health risks, such as abusing drugs or having unprotected sex, according to a 2014 study of 76 participants. To instill these skills, have children make a list of possible alternative choices before making a decision. Brainstorm with them about potential consequences of each choice, or ask them to justify their decision by explaining it to another person. Resources on teaching decision-making can be found at ,. ,Also, teaching children friendship skills and involving them in activities with sensible, goal-oriented peers foster the kind of social ties that help keep adolescents safe. Teens who drive with risk-loving peers are more likely to crash, but the presence of peers who have better self-control tends to lower teen drivers’ crash rate, according to ,of 42 newly licensed teen drivers.,—Email ,.,

Media agencies are increasingly selling digital ad space. And now, a creative agency is playing the line-blurring game as it brings digital publishing and agency staffers together to service one massive account. , , said Monday it will consolidate its creative account with , , following a months-long review in which the incumbents, Omnicom-owned DDB and , ,’s Leo Burnett duked it out for the coveted business. ,DDB didn’t win on its own. Employees from Google, Facebook and the , ,’ content studio T Brands supported the pitch, and they will be embedded at an agency that Omnicom is customizing for McDonald’s, DDB CEO Wendy Clark said in an interview.,Staffers from the outside companies will support content creation and contribute to a team of around 200 employees, including people from Omnicom Media Group’s digital-buying and data hub Annalect, its small creative shop Sparks & Honey and its digital agency Critical Mass, among other agencies. ,The new McDonald’s agency offers a glimpse not only into the agency of the future, but also the agency of the past, when media buyers and creatives lived under the same roof. The company is taking that structure one step further with the embedded digital media talent. ,Nearly all major digital and traditional media publishers have their own ad services groups through which they help brands create “custom” or “branded” content for their own websites. Omnicom is trying to tap into the expertise and relationships they’ve built up. ,With the “size and scale” of the McDonald’s account, “it makes sense for them to have people embedded as part of the agency,” said Ms. Clark. “They can see the inner workings and know the campaigns.” ,The new customized shop will move into the office of media agency OMD in Chicago, said Ms. Clark. Staffers from Alma, the multicultural agency, will also sit with the team. ,The publishers aren’t being compensated for participating, she said. She didn’t elaborate on what was in it for staffers. ,Media and multicultural accounts, which are both overseen by Omnicom agencies, were not part of the McDonald’s review. ,Large media agencies like OMD, which has worked with McDonald’s for a number of years, buy a lot of media inventory from companies like Facebook and Google.,The concept of media embeds, and digital media embeds specifically, isn’t new. , , and Google ,with swapping employees in 2008. ,Nor is the dedicated agency team model. Remember Enfatico, the now-defunct dedicated shop that , , created for Dell? There are also success stories, such as Omnicom’s , , United and WPP’s Team Ford and Plus for Chanel.,As people from different agencies cozy up under the same agency roofs, ad shops and media publishers have increasingly teamed up, and more media agencies have taken on the role of media seller. Last year, Deep Focus inked agreements with a handful of digital media companies to co-create content for brands, and WPP and Publicis continue to take ownership of digital media inventory that they then sell to clients. , ,Alexandra Bruell at , ,

How Managers Get ‘Interim’ Out of Their Titles,Sue Shellenbarger,"This copy is for your personal, non-commercial use only. To order presentation-ready copies for distribution to your colleagues, clients or customers visit http://www.djreprints.com.,http://www.wsj.com/articles/how-managers-get-interim-out-of-their-titles-1472572415,Is it a promotion? Or a curse? You’ve just been named an interim manager.,Being asked to take on a job temporarily while your employer looks for a candidate to fill the position permanently poses new career possibilities and perils. Successful interim managers use this time to show everyone what they can do—and potentially win the job permanently. They often, however, lack the authority and support to make changes. And being cast as a stand-in for a role you really want can be hard on the ego.,“Interim roles are often fraught with ambiguity. You’re appointed to a role, but you’re being told, ‘We’re not actually sure you’re the one,’ ” says ,Rick Lash,, a senior partner in Toronto with the executive-search firm , , , ,Luis Almeida, has been accomplishing as much as he can since his recent appointment as an interim department chair in Jackson State University’s School of Journalism and Media Studies in Jackson, Miss. He is broadening his network by making speeches to community groups.,His boss, ,Elayne Haynes-Anthony,, dean of the school, praises Dr. Almeida’s work starting new programs and projects, and calls him a “shining star.” The only problem, she says, is that he ""wants to do so much so quickly,” that she wonders whether he can keep up the pace and sometimes warns him not to overdo it., , , , ,Dr. Almeida says he’s been working quickly to build relationships in the community, but he’s careful to get colleagues’ approval before acting and to involve them in decision-making. As an interim leader, “you go more slowly, to make sure you have buy-in” from those who will be affected, says Dr. Almeida, an associate professor of communications. “Making an impact is definitely a challenge.”, , for interim managers is thinking they can succeed using the same skills that earned them the promotion, Mr. Lash says. Interim assignments are usually a stretch to a higher level with more complex tasks and relationships.,Mark Jagiela made clear last fall, when he told ,Greg Smith, he was being considered for the presidency of , ,’s biggest business unit, that he needed to develop new skills to win the job permanently, says Mr. Jagiela, president and chief executive officer of the North Reading, Mass.-based maker of electronic-device testing systems. Mr. Smith, Teradyne’s vice president of marketing, wasn’t given the title of interim president of the semiconductor-test unit, but he was expected to begin stepping into the role, and several colleagues knew he was one of several candidates being considered.,Mr. Jagiela “was extremely frank about the areas where he felt I needed to step up,” Mr. Smith says. Teradyne hired executive coach ,Craig Bentley, of Bates Communications in Wellesley, Mass., to help Mr. Smith learn a concise style of answering questions during meetings with the board: listening closely to the questioner, giving brief, focused answers and noticing whether the listener was interested and satisfied. Mr. Bentley also helped Mr. Smith polish his quarterly video presentations to the company’s 3,000 employees. ,Mr. Smith eased into leading his team. “It was a challenge to define the decisions that I could drive, and those that required Mark’s blessing,” Mr. Smith says. “You have to know the limits of your authority.” He steered clear of most personnel decisions, but proposed an increase in social-media marketing for his division, the semiconductor test unit. Last February, Mr. Smith won the title, as division president.,Most interim assignments last 6 to 18 months, although some go longer. Interim managers should talk often with the hiring boss to report on how things are going and ask for feedback. For updates on where you stand in the horse race, it’s wise to schedule monthly, quarterly or semiannual meetings in advance, based on when the boss or hiring committee expects to have enough information to respond.,The ambiguity of interim assignments often robs appointees of “the typical ‘honeymoon’ grace period, when people give you the benefit of the doubt, where you get to try new things and bring fresh ideas without judgment,” says ,Suzanne Bates,, chief executive of Bates Communications and author of “All the Leader You Can Be.” If the boss already knows your work, colleagues “wonder why you weren’t just given the job.”,Interim managers “have to check their ego at the door” and not worry about “the labels people are going to put on them,” says ,Tim Tolan,, chief executive of the Tolan Group, a St. Augustine, Fla., affiliate of the Sanford Rose Associates executive-search network. Co-workers’ level of respect “has a lot to do with the way you see yourself in that job.”, ,Catalina Beasley-Martin, of Rosemont, Ill., a human-resources manager for a nonprofit health-care organization, was recently named interim HR director while her employer searches for candidates to take the job. Ms. Beasley-Martin isn’t sure she wants the job permanently, because that might force her to give up an additional role she enjoys, as corporate safety officer, setting policies and programs to keep employees safe on the job.,The interim title gives her just enough power, however, to solve some internal problems she has noticed, such as creating new communication tools to ease managers’ confusion about complex policies such as family leave. “I like fixing things that need to be fixed,” says Ms. Beasley-Martin, who has 10 years’ experience as an HR manager at other employers. For her, the assignment “is purely about, what can I do to make a difference in the short time I have?” ,

More from The Wall Street Journal’s ‘Work & Family’ column,Being passed over after competing so visibly for permanent status can be bruising. “Grace and composure are critical. Take the high road” and avoid criticizing your successor or your bosses’ decision, Ms. Bates says. “Find out why you weren’t selected without challenging the decision.” Then, figure out if there’s still a place for you in the organization or if you should apply out.,Performing well in an interim assignment can open other doors. Ms. Bates worked with a client who was passed over last year for a senior vice president slot. The manager had shown such strong strategic-thinking skills while competing for the job, however, that his bosses created a new position, as an adviser to the CEO., ,Sue Shellenbarger at , ,

Now that video revenue program, called the Amplify Publisher Program, is being extended to individual creators also.,The program will provide “approved creators in the U.S. with the ability to monetize their videos, which is as simple as ‘checking a box’ prior to Tweeting,” read a blog post published Tuesday by Guy Snir, a product manager at Twitter.,Creators will keep 70% of the revenue generated from ads sold against their content, with Twitter taking a 30% cut, according to a person familiar with the matter. That’s the same revenue split that Twitter has had in place with major publishers already participating in the Amplify Publisher Program.,In an emailed statement, Twitter said it will evaluate creator eligibility for the program on a case-by-case basis.,“Those who would like to participate in Twitter’s Amplify Publisher Program should be video-centric digital creators who have audiences and content that will compel brands to advertise against them,” the statement read.,Program participants will have the option to opt-in to ads appearing before their content on a tweet-by-tweet basis, if they wish, or to make all of the video content they publish available, Twitter said. Creators will also retain the right to monetize the same content on other platforms.,The program expansion could potentially result in more advertising revenue for Twitter, since it may have more ad inventory available to sell.,Publishers that have already sold advertising through the Amplify program include BuzzFeed, Vox Media, Aol, Fox, MTV, Time, Mashable, Funny Or Die, Univision and others., ,Jack Marshall at , ,

Sling TV Targets Cord-Cutters With New Ad Campaign,Shalini Ramachandran,"This copy is for your personal, non-commercial use only. To order presentation-ready copies for distribution to your colleagues, clients or customers visit http://www.djreprints.com.,http://www.wsj.com/articles/sling-tv-targets-cord-cutters-with-new-ad-campaign-1472562002,Sling TV is making it official: the streaming service is going after cord-cutters.,Until now, executives at Dish Network Corp., the satellite TV provider that owns Sling TV, have largely insisted that the $20-a-month streaming service ,—younger consumers who have never signed up for a pay TV subscription. ,That message was aimed at reassuring big TV companies who were nervous about licensing just a few of their channels to Sling TV, rather than their full suite of networks. Part of the concern was that supporting Sling TV’s slimmed-down, cheaper streaming bundle would encourage more people to “cut the cord,” meaning cancel their traditional pay TV subscriptions, which are still the backbone of the TV ecosystem.,Now Sling TV executives say they are pulling out all the stops in a multimillion-dollar campaign aimed at attracting those cord-cutters. ,The nationwide ad campaign, which will run across TV, digital, print, and social channels, features “Machete” star Danny Trejo growling about how “evil” and “scary” cable TV companies are, with their long-term contracts and pricing lures that make you end up paying more than $100 a month. ,In the ad, Sling TV compares those pain points with its low price, no hidden fees and no long-term contracts—effectively encouraging disgruntled cable subscribers to cut the cord and sign up. ,Sling TV Chief Executive ,Roger Lynch,’s pitch is that the streaming service will give a place for fed-up cable customers to go where they can still pay to watch a selection of TV channels, as opposed to leave the ecosystem entirely. ,“We’re not creating sentiment; we’re reflecting that it is the growing percentage of the market,” said Sling TV Chief Marketing Officer Glenn Eisen. The idea with the campaign is to “ratchet up the tone” against traditional pay TV, he said.,Sling TV’s biggest programming partners, including ESPN’s majority-owner , ,, have been under pressure from investors due to increased worries about subscriber losses as more consumers downgrade to skinnier bundles of channels. ,In the past few months, Sling TV has grown its content offerings, signing up programmers like the NFL Network, NBCUniversal and , , and has begun offering a ,, an upgrade from its original single-stream service. Mr. Lynch said recent moves from wireless carriers like , , and , , to ,were another encouraging factor, given that one-third of Sling TV’s unique viewers a week watch using a mobile phone.,The campaign may also be a move of necessity. Dish doesn’t break out Sling TV customers from its traditional satellite TV subscribers. But even with the benefit of Sling TV growth, Dish lost 304,000 subscribers in the first half of this year, compared with a loss of 46,000 during the same period a year ago.,When Sling TV launched in early 2015, Mr. Lynch said, the addressable market was 21 million homes—16 million cord-nevers and 5 million people who had cut the cord over the prior few years. He said both groups are “certainly growing.” ,“Millennials watch fewer hours of traditional TV a day,” Mr. Lynch said. “We expect that to continue.”, ,Shalini Ramachandran at , ,

One disavows personal responsibility and moral agency; the other commands them. One is a recipe for economic failure and political squalor; the other for success.,Mr. Lewis, who recently turned 100, was writing about the...

"At Ports, a Sign of Altered Supply Chains    ","Erica E. Phillips,Robbie Whelan","This copy is for your personal, non-commercial use only. To order presentation-ready copies for distribution to your colleagues, clients or customers visit http://www.djreprints.com.,http://www.wsj.com/articles/at-ports-a-sign-of-altered-supply-chains-1472501576,This summer, dockworkers, truckers and railroads geared up for a surge of retail goods passing through U.S. ports that hasn’t occurred.,Imports are flat at major seaports on both coasts heading into peak shipping season, the stretch in late summer and early fall when retailers usually load up on imported toys, clothing and other merchandise to sell to holiday shoppers. If the trend holds, it will be the second year in a row without a traditional peak.,Economists say subdued activity on the docks is a sign of how retailers are slimming down their supply chains as more of their customers shop online. Companies such as , ,, Lowe’s Cos. and , , are pivoting away from maintaining stores brimming with merchandise. Instead, they are housing more goods in warehouses where they can quickly ship to stores or fulfill online orders.,It is a shift that has caught the transportation sector off guard. Ports from New York to Georgia to California have spent billions of dollars to upgrade equipment and deepen harbors to handle an expected flood of imports that has yet to materialize. Shipping lines are scrapping vessels and cutting back service on unprofitable routes. Trucking companies bought tens of thousands of new big rigs as recently as 2015, many of which sit idle today.,“My drivers say, ‘Boy, we’ve never seen it so slow,’ ” said ,Fred Otterbein,, who heads the Savannah, Ga., office of port trucking company First Coast Logistics Inc. “It may be the new normal.”,U.S. ports are on pace to handle 2.2% more imports this year, the slowest rate of growth since 2011, according to Hackett Associates LLC, a consulting firm. In July, when shipping volumes typically start their peak-season ramp-up, imports fell at the nation’s two busiest port complexes, in Southern California and New York. The National Retail Federation estimates that August and September will continue the trend, with import volumes down slightly for both months from the same period last year.,The slowdown extends to the nation’s highways and railroads. Freight carried by road and rail fell 2.6% in July compared with the same month in 2015, the 17th consecutive month of year-over-year declines, according to data company , ,“The running joke going around is that flat is the new growth,” said ,Jett McCandless,, chief executive of transportation-technology startup project44.,Freight volumes are stagnating despite strong consumer spending, which rose for a fourth-straight month in July. ,: More of those dollars are being spent online, or on entertainment and services such as health care.,Many retailers are stuck with large amounts of unsold goods as a result, reducing their need to import more merchandise. Even after a year of attempting to slim down inventories, retailers’ ratio of inventories to sales, a measure of excess stocks, touched 1.5 in June, close to a seven-year high, according to the Census Bureau. In their most recent earnings reports, Target and Lowe’s reported inventories up more than 4% over the same period last year.,J.C. Penney is placing “slightly smaller orders…or holding back quite a bit” to reduce inventories, ,Mike Robbins,, J.C. Penney’s executive vice president for supply chain, told investors in June. The company has reduced the size of some orders at the beginning of major shopping seasons by as much as 70%.,The focus on reducing inventories is proving to be a drag on growth because it signals that businesses are spending less, and might be pessimistic about future demand. Inventory drawdowns cut second-quarter growth by 1.26 percentage points, to just 1.1%.,Shipping lines are struggling to plan their routes as order volumes become more difficult to predict, said ,Niels Erich,, spokesman for a group of 15 major shipping lines known as the Transpacific Stabilization Agreement. In the past, carriers could count on the peak summer months to make up for slower winter trade.,“Now that doesn’t exist in the same way, it’s all kind of flat,” he said.,Some analysts expect retailers to place last-minute orders closer to the holidays, which could make up for some of the softness in imports that ports are experiencing now. J.C. Penney, for one, expects to place smaller orders for certain products that typically sell strongly throughout the holiday shopping season, Mr. Robbins said.,If those orders materialize, they could come in via air, usually the fastest mode of freight transportation, analysts say.,Long term, retailers will need to step up imports as they run through inventories, particularly if consumer demand stays strong. But a return to double-digit percentage growth at the ports appears unlikely, said ,Jock O’Connell,, an international trade economist.,“What’s really going to drive import trade is simply the domestic demand for goods,” he said., ,Erica E. Phillips at , and Robbie Whelan at , ,

Facebook Pushes Advertisers to Speed Up Their Mobile Sites,Jack Marshall,"This copy is for your personal, non-commercial use only.

By considering website performance and a person’s network connection, we can improve that experience and help drive the outcomes advertisers are looking for,” a Facebook spokesman said.,In a , page on Wednesday, Facebook outlined a number of ways advertisers could technically improve their websites for better load times. It suggested improving their sites for mobile by minimizing landing page redirects, using less code and compressing files.,“Many businesses haven’t optimized their website for mobile yet and still have very slow loading times. This can lead to negative experiences for people, and problems for businesses such as site abandonment, missed business objectives and inaccurate measurement,” the post said.,As much as 40% of website visitors abandon a site once there has been a loading delay of 3 seconds, Facebook said, citing a report by technology research company Aberdeen Group.,For its part, Facebook said it would begin “prefetching” advertisers’ websites to help speed up their loading times even further.,This will essentially involve Facebook’s app pre-loading a version of an advertiser’s site before a user even taps on an ad, which Facebook said can shorten mobile site load time by up to 29%, improving the experience and decreasing the risk of the consumer leaving the page and moving on to something else.,The social network has already been “prefetching” content posted to its service from publishers’ websites, a Facebook spokesman said. It’s now extending that functionality to advertising.,Advertisers won’t need to opt-in to have their sites preloaded by Facebook, nor will they have the option to opt-out. Facebook will determine which content it will preload, based on how likely it believes users are to tap on different ads. ,Facebook also pointed to “mobile-optimized” publishing solutions it offers, as an alternative to advertisers driving users off Facebook to their own websites. It offers ,, for example, which enables advertisers to publish detailed advertising content directly to the social network itself.,Meanwhile, Facebook offers a similar feature for publishers in Instant Articles, whereby they can post their content directly to Facebook’s systems and have it load faster for users as a result.,Facebook’s online ad rival Google has similarly been pushing marketers and publishers to speed up their mobile websites. The company uses page load speed as a signal to rank websites on its search engine results pages, for example, and it launched a project called Accelerated Mobile Pages in October.,As part of that initiative Google also announced its ,, which is designed to help marketers and their agencies build faster ads with a set of collaborative industry technology standards., ,Jack Marshall at , ,

Fox Markets Skip Bayless Show on ESPN’s Turf,Joe Flint,"This copy is for your personal, non-commercial use only. To order presentation-ready copies for distribution to your colleagues, clients or customers visit http://www.djreprints.com.,http://www.wsj.com/articles/fox-markets-skip-bayless-show-on-espns-turf-1472724001,Sports commentator Skip Bayless’ last day at ESPN was over two months ago but the folks there might be seeing his face again on their commutes to and from the office.,As part of its marketing campaign promoting the arrival of Mr. Bayless to Fox Sports 1 on Sept. 6, the network bought space on three billboards within a five mile radius of ESPN’s Bristol, Conn. headquarters.,“I guess there were billboards put up where you can find lots of sports fans,” said Jamie Horowitz, president of Fox Sports National Networks. Mr. Horowitz is no stranger to Bristol; he spent several years at ESPN as a programming executive. “First Take,” which featured Mr. Bayless and Stephen A. Smith, was one of the shows Mr. Horowitz oversaw there.,At times a polarizing personality with opinions that drive many fans crazy, Mr. Bayless is known for his love of former National Football League quarterback Tim Tebow. He took heat over the summer for mocking National Basketball Association star LeBron James’ skills after he led the Cleveland Cavaliers to a championship. Years ago he got in hot water for questioning a former Dallas Cowboy quarterback’s sexuality.,“It’s fair to say Skip doesn’t shy away from controversial issues,” said Mr. Horowitz, adding that he “reflects the spirit of Fox, which is rebellious and relentless and at times defiant.”,At Fox Sports 1, Mr. Bayless is being paired with former Denver Broncos star Shannon Sharpe on “Skip and Shannon Undisputed.”,Mr. Horowitz is betting Mr. Bayless can bring that same passion and attention-getting style to a channel that is still struggling to make a dent against ESPN. “I don’t think there is anyone talking about sports that is better at being incisive and insightful,” he said.,It won’t take too much for Mr. Bayless to improve ratings in the 9:30 a.m. to 12 p.m. slot that will be home for “Undisputed.” For the past year, Fox Sports 1 has averaged 37,000 viewers in that time slot with a mix of studio shows and live events, according to Nielsen. “First Take” on ESPN2 averaged 434,000 viewers in Mr. Bayless’ last year.,Besides bombarding Bristol with billboards, Fox Sports 1 is promoting the arrival of Mr. Bayless heavily on its own network and other properties owned by parent company , , as well as on YouTube, Yahoo Sports and Bleacher Report. The network said the campaign for “Undisputed” is one of its biggest ever for a studio show.,Fox Sports 1 is also giving Mr. Bayless the red carpet treatment inside the company. He sat down this week with ,Peter Rice,, who as chairman and chief executive officer of Fox Networks Group is the highest-ranking television executive at 21st Century Fox. Even 21st Century Fox Chief Executive ,James Murdoch, reached out to welcome Mr. Bayless to Fox Sports 1.,This isn’t the first time Fox Sports has tweaked ESPN after poaching one of its stars. Years ago, when Fox Sports first tried launching a national service, it wooed away Keith Olbermann and also made sure everyone in Bristol knew. Unfortunately Mr. Olbermann’s show only lasted three years.,21st Century Fox and Wall Street Journal-owner , , share common ownership., ,Joe Flint at , ,

This approach can shorten site load time by up to 29%, Facebook says. At the same time, Facebook is telling advertisers that if they don’t optimize their own sites for mobile, they could find that their ads aren’t delivered to users with slow connections. Translation: it’s a good time to hire that mobile optimization guy. Streamlining mobile access is becoming a theme. Facebook has been doing the same thing with publishers -- that’s Instant Articles -- and Google’s Amp project plays the same notes. , ,: Multiple incidents over the past year have underscored Madison Avenue’s lack of diversity and the fact that much of the cringeworthy behavior depicted in “Mad Men” lives on in 2016. Amid all the disturbing developments,, the WSJ Media Mix podcast and offered an interesting theory on why sexism and other isms persist in the industry. The leaders setting the tone represent a “closed loop of white guys talking to white guys about other white guys,” she said. So these white guys, who often sit atop ad agencies making big salaries, aren’t about to shake things up too much--and they’re probably less likely to be influenced by non-white-guy-thinking. Thus change feels glacial--if it is even happening at all. “If it were happening, those regular lighting rod moments wouldn’t happen,” she said. Check out the episode and subscribe on ,, ,, ,or Stitcher. , ,: The Olympics and VMAs may have been ratings disappointments, but the most reliable of live event programming is around the corner: NFL games. Here’s betting that the numbers for NFL broadcasts will be as strong as ever. How confident are advertisers? ,, reports Broadcasting and Cable. Consider that NBCUniversal locked up $1.2 billion just prior to the recent Rio Olympics (the company was hoping to bring in more ads during the Games), and struggled with its ratings guarantees. TV network sales executives say that had zero impact on the NFL sales, and that they’ve all sold more ad inventory than last season, at higher prices, according to B&C. It makes sense. While the Olympics has its issues with live viewing, and the tape-delayed, bloated, profile-heavy content really bucks up against the way people watch TV these days, the NFL is a cross-generational annual ritual. If its numbers slip this year, then it’s really time to panic it TV land. , ,: This digital company is planning to roll out 32 short-form Web shows between now and early 2017. It’s brought on 200 staffers for these projects, which include a travel series, a documentary on the Real Madrid legendary soccer club, and a show focused on New York motorcycle cops in training.

Ship Operators Explore Autonomous Sailing,"Robert Wall,Costas Paris","This copy is for your personal, non-commercial use only. To order presentation-ready copies for distribution to your colleagues, clients or customers visit http://www.djreprints.com.,http://www.wsj.com/articles/ship-operators-explore-autonomous-sailing-1472635800,“All hands on deck” may become a thing of the past.,Ship designers, their operators and regulators are gearing up for a future in which cargo vessels sail the oceans with minimal or even no crew. Advances in automation and ample bandwidth even far offshore could herald the biggest change in shipping since diesel engines replaced steam.,Ship operators believe more automation will enable them to optimize ship use, including cutting fuel consumption. “The benefit of automation is as an enabler of further efficiency across the 630 vessels we operate,” said ,Palle Laursen,, head of Maersk Line Ship Management, a unit of cargo-ship giant , , A/S.,British engine maker , , PLC is leading the Advanced Autonomous Waterborne Applications initiative involving other companies and universities. It foresees technologies long used to improve commercial airline operations migrating to ships. The group also is tapping know-how from those working on driverless cars to adapt for safe at-sea autonomous operations.,A future unmanned ship could resemble some of the most advanced combat drones. It would sport infrared detectors, high-resolution cameras and laser sensors to monitor its surroundings. The vast troves of data would be transmitted to command centers where staff do little more than monitor progress and ensure ships are operating at optimum speeds.,The consortium completed a study this year that concluded such vessels are feasible and offer savings., ,Oskar Levander,, vice president for innovation at Rolls-Royce’s marine unit, said moving toward greater autonomy and unmanned shipping could cut transport costs 22%. The bulk would come from lower staff costs, though such vessels also would be more fuel efficient by eliminating the need to carry equipment to support people onboard.,The first steps already are being taken. The Stella ferry, used in the Baltic and operated by Finferries, has been equipped with a variety of sensors including lasers and thermal cameras to assess whether such sensors could allow autonomous operations. ,A critical step toward floating remotely controlled unmanned cargo ships on the oceans by 2030, and autonomous ones by 2035, is the ability to pass large amounts of data from ship to shore to ensure safe operations. For years, lack of affordable bandwidth has made that a challenge. A new generation of communications satellites is promising lower costs to transfer data.,Satellite-services company , , PLC this year launched its Fleet Xpress service to provide improved connectivity to ship operators. It combines high-bandwidth satellites with a more secure connection to guarantee vital safety connectivity. ,Ronald Spithout,, president of Inmarsat’s maritime business, said the connection will let operators monitor engine and other ship functions more closely to enable enhanced automation.,Rolls-Royce, no longer affiliated with the luxury car maker, is betting that a push to smarter vessels will lift the fortunes of its struggling marine business. The prolonged slump in crude prices has led to a sharp drop in demand for sophisticated offshore vessels. Marine sales at Rolls-Royce fell 23% last year after declining 16% the prior year when oil prices started to slump.,Oil prices may rebound, but the demand for the gold-plated vessels used to service oil and gas rigs far offshore may never fully recover, said ,Mikael Makinen,, president of Rolls-Royce’s marine division. Rolls-Royce is betting smart ships will be a new growth market.,The company is already in talks with operators it wouldn’t name to start trials of more autonomous vessels.,Automating shipping faces barriers, though. “There are a vast range of safety, security, navigational and legal challenges to be solved before crewless container vessels can be considered in our fleet,” said Maersk’s Mr. Laursen.,The International Maritime Organization, the arm of the United Nations overseeing global shipping, prohibits ship operations without crew. The International Convention for the Safety of Life at Sea, known as Solas, requires all ships to be “sufficiently and efficiently manned,” the IMO said.,Safety rules emerged in 1914 in the wake of the sinking of the RMS Titanic two years earlier, which killed more than 1,500 passengers on the ship’s maiden trans-Atlantic voyage. Current rules, completed in 1974, have been adapted for new technologies such as introducing mandatory requirements for electronic charts and automatic identification systems for ships. Proponents of greater autonomy hope the rules may be further relaxed.,Separately, it is unclear as of yet how security issues like piracy and the mandate to help distressed ships will be addressed for these ships,IMO spokeswoman Natasha Brown said the British government-sponsored Marine Autonomous Systems Regulatory Working Group, set up in 2014, is reviewing pertinent regulations to potentially propose changes., ,James Fanshawe,, chairman of the working group, said it hopes to convince the international organization to pave the way for autonomous vessels before the end of the decade.,Capt. Thanasis Apostolopoulos, head of crews at Athens-based Springfield Shipping Co. and a sailor for 17 years, said the drive to unmanned ships may be inevitable. “It will be a sad day for seafarers when it happens,” he said., ,Robert Wall at , and Costas Paris at , ,

C.H. Robinson Buys APC Logistics for $225 Million to Expand in Australia  ,Loretta Chao,"This copy is for your personal, non-commercial use only. To order presentation-ready copies for distribution to your colleagues, clients or customers visit http://www.djreprints.com.,http://www.wsj.com/articles/c-h-robinson-buys-apc-logistics-for-225-million-to-expand-in-australia-1472684433,Logistics provider , , said Wednesday that it would acquire APC Logistics, which provides freight forwarding and customs brokerage services in Australia and New Zealand, part of a global expansion effort the company says will better serve e-commerce-related shippers.,C.H. Robinson will pay $225 million in cash for APC, the latest in a string of acquisitions totaling more than $1 billion since 2010. The company’s last acquisition was Freightquote.com Inc., an online trucking marketplace for which it paid $365 million in early 2015.,Based in Eden Prairie, Minn., C.H. Robinson has operations in 37 countries and worked exclusively with APC for freight forwarding between the U.S. and Australia, said ,John Wiehoff,, C.H. Robinson’s chairman and chief executive. Australia is a growing market in which APC has a roughly 10% market share, and acquiring the company will enable C.H. Robinson to capture some shipments moving from Europe and Asia to Australia as well, he added.,“We’re excited about being able to go after more of that market share,” Mr. Wiehoff said. APC will be integrated into C.H. Robinson’s global forwarding division.,The logistics industry has seen a whirlwind of acquisitions in recent years, which Mr. Wiehoff believes is a result of the changing needs of shippers as online shopping grows. As retailers are moving goods through their supply chains at a faster pace, traditional processes such as faxing information between agents are no longer sufficient, he said.,“Most large retailers that we’re working with today are going through tremendous changes around e-commerce and how their stores and products get distributed to all their customers around the world,” he said. That has created a greater need for freight forwarders to have their own operations globally, and linked to the same technology platforms so providers can more efficiently consolidate, deconsolidate and track shipments.,C.H. Robinson plans to continue to be interested acquisitions that could further its global expansion plans, Mr. Wiehoff said, though the company isn't looking at any other company specifically at the moment.,The rapid pace of acquisitions has prompted concerns among investors and analysts over the ability of logistics companies to merge such far-flung operations. Mr. Wiehoff said this is something C.H. Robinson also fears, but not with APC because the companies have worked together for decades. “We’ve known them for a long time. We have a good operating relationship with them,” he said.,Melbourne, Australia-based APC Logistics is a privately held international freight forwarder that provides ocean, air and customs brokerage to companies shipping into and out of Australia and New Zealand. The company, which has 300 employees in nine offices across the region, had $251 million in revenue for its latest fiscal year, which ended June 30.,C.H. Robinson reported $3.30 billion in revenue for the latest quarter. The company’s shares closed at $69.42, down from a 12-month high of more than $75 in April., ,Loretta Chao at , ,

Making the ad business more diverse is a challenge given its current structure.,“At the top of our industry, as at the top of every industry, there is a closed loop of white guys talking to white guys about other white guys,” she said on the ,. “Those white guys are sitting very pretty. They’ve got their enormous salaries, their gigantic bonuses, their lavish expense accounts, and their huge pool of stock options. Why on earth would they ever want to rock the boat?”,Just a few weeks ago, ,Kevin Roberts,, the former executive chairman of Publicis Groupe’s Saatchi & Saatchi, resigned following an interview where he largely dismissed the gender diversity issue. In fact, Mr. Roberts , that Ms. Gallop is “making up a lot of the stuff to create a profile.”,“Every few months, something like this happens in our industry. A senior white guy becomes a lightning rod for this issue,” Ms. Gallop said. “The depressing thing is that means change isn’t happening. If it were happening, those regular lighting rod moments wouldn’t happen.”,Ms. Gallop said that, for marketers and agencies, diversity should be considered a business imperative. Ads created by a group of creative minds more representative of the overall gender and racial mix of the population would reflect the increasingly diverse pool of would-be consumers.,Scripted training and mapped-out hiring initiatives aren’t the answer, Ms. Gallop said. Companies that implement a diversity program in practice often feel fine carrying on as things are, she said. “Studies have proven that if you do something that’s virtuous, you then feel that gives you license to do something that isn’t. At a very basic level, if you substitute diet soda for your full-fat soda, you can now go eat a bag of chips,” she said.,Ms. Gallop noted that women sometimes tell her that they do not want to be hired just because they are women. “My response is, ‘Get over it.’ All around you are mediocre men who got hired because they were men. Get hired because you’re a woman, welcome the opportunity and then do the bloody brilliant job in that role you’re going to do anyway, and prove how much you deserve it.”,For more with Ms. Gallop, check out the episode and subscribe on ,, ,, , or Stitcher., ,Steven Perlberg at , ,

The Craziest Reason to Visit Zurich,Anna Russell," IN 1916, in the first of many manifestos, German artist Hugo Ball wrote of Dada: “Just a word, and the word a movement. Very easy to understand.

On the stage of the theater where the art movement was founded a century ago, chaotic performances were under way. A man shouted in German and made a smoothie. Later, a performer practiced pliés over a model of the Eiffel Tower; another slathered himself in mayonnaise.,While in Switzerland...

CMO Today: Google’s Role in Media Buying Rebates,Mike Shields,"This copy is for your personal, non-commercial use only.

Someone is paying those rebates, of course. AdExchanger reports on a, The idea is to encourage buyers to open their wallets a bit more for Google ads -- and the payments to agencies can range from 4-6% of that investment if spending thresholds are met, the story notes. Not all agencies take the money, and whether they distribute it fully to clients may vary. Unethical? One expert said so long as brands understand what they’re getting into, no. But ensuring that everyone feels treated fairly -- Google, the agency and the client -- is extremely difficult., ,: Remember when you’d only see a short video ad on Twitter prior to a college football highlight or a clip from a TV awards broadcast? That’s quickly changing. , reports CMO Today. That means any creator who gets the nod from Twitter (you have to be “approved”) can upload a video to the platform, check a box, and start earning revenue from pre-roll ads running before clips. Digital influencers, particularly ones who appeal to young consumers, are less known for having big Twitter followings (perhaps because Twitter is packed with journalists and tech wonks, not teens). Which ones will jump on board first? Which ones will Twitter approve? And will users be ok with more ads in their feeds? Meanwhile, CMO Today reports that , (the one , , recently invested in) to power its live-streaming of NFL games and other sports content. , ,: Speculation has mounted in recent months that if Republican presidential candidate ,Donald Trump, loses the election he may be positioning himself for a future as the head of a new hard-right, populist media empire. Mr. Trump is, after all, cozy with many conservative media folks; he’s made the head of Breitbart News his campaign’s CEO and is consulting with ousted Fox News chief ,Roger Ailes,, according to various reports. But would a Trump TV network make any sense in the current media climate, where cable networks are disappearing (RIP Pivot) and distribution gets tougher as bundles shrink? Not to mention, would mainstream advertisers want to touch some of Team Trump’s rhetoric? Instead, ,, reports Bloomberg. Mr. Beck has nabbed 400,000 paying subscribers--yet he may have already hit a ceiling. Would people want to pay up for commentary from Mr. Trump (or his followers) when they’ve gotten so much of that for free over the past two years? , ,: What did , , mean on Monday when it announced that it was consolidating its creative ad business with , , after a 35-year relationship with Leo Burnett as part of a search for the “agency of the future”? It turns out, ,, reports CMO Today. On the retro side of things, McDonald’s is pushing to have media buying and creative services in one place, and is creating a dedicated agency for the fast-food giant -- we have seen those movies before. On the other hand, Omnicom will be embedding staffers from Google, , , and the , ,’ content studio T Brands, who will help with creating branded content as part of a team of some 200 employees. In fact, employees from those outside companies even helped on the pitch--an arrangement that apparently impressed McDonald’s.

Before the launch, the four-year-old company had focused its resources on ocean and land shipping, but offered fewer options for shippers looking for speedier ways to move their freight. ,By acquiring Spanish startup WebCargoNet, which maintains a database of global air-freight rates, Freightos can list a wider variety of routes and modes of transportation in its marketplace, said Chief Executive Zvi Schreiber. ,“WebCargoNet have a very good asset, which we don’t have,” he said.,WebCargoNet is based in Spain and owned by its two founders, who developed the software program as college students.

To order presentation-ready copies for distribution to your colleagues, clients or customers visit http://www.djreprints.com.,http://www.wsj.com/articles/logistics-transport-hiring-soared-in-august-1472836435,Logistics and transportation companies added 14,900 jobs in August, the U.S. Labor Department said Friday, extending strong hiring growth for a second month despite reports of low shipping volumes and manufacturing activity.,Warehousing and storage companies led the surge, adding 4,300 jobs to its steady incline as online shopping growth fuels demand for more workers to package and ship goods. ,. Courier and messenger companies, which also benefit from the e-commerce boom, added 4,000 jobs in last month and have expanded employment by 22,600 jobs over the past year.,Industry consultants say companies in industries close to e-commerce have been hiring earlier than usual in anticipation of the annual crush of shipments for the holidays as a tighter job market and rising wages in other sectors have created more competition for workers.,

,Trucking firms, which shed jobs for most of the first half of the year due to weak demand, added 3,400 jobs in August after adding 1,700 jobs in July. Even rail transportation jobs saw some relief, adding 100 jobs in August after cutting over 24,000 of jobs over the last year amid a steep decline in coal and energy shipments.,The growth in logistics industries came as ,, slower than the 270,000 jobs added in both June and July, and short of economists’ expectations. But the added jobs come as other indicators call for caution for the transportation industry. ,Imports at major U.S. ports have been flat going into what should be a late summer peak, and reports earlier this month indicated ,, with spending in shipping decreasing as well. , , , one of the largest trucking firms in the U.S., said Friday that less-than-truckload shipments, in which shipments from multiple customers are carried on the same trucks, declined by 1.5% in August from the same month last year. ODFL Chief Executive ,David Congdon, said the carrier saw “an operating environment that continued to be challenging.”,The Institute for Supply Management said Thursday that ,. Manufacturers slashed 14,000 jobs in August, reversing some of the sector’s gains in recent months. Goods-producing industries overall cut 24,000 jobs for the month. ,“This month brings more manufacturing jobs losses, including in the automotive sector, where sales are declining. That’s been a recent bright spot for U.S. manufacturing, and its slump really highlights the global headwinds America is facing,” said Scott Paul, president of the Alliance for American Manufacturing., ,Loretta Chao at , ,

It’s time to get serious again. Plus, ,is only a few weeks away.,Here are 10 of the most crucial questions that the media and advertising industry needs to tackle once the white linen pants and flip flops have been stowed away:, , ,The court battles with controlling shareholder Sumner Redstone have wound down, and , as part of the settlement. There’s a new expanded board in place, more power in the hands of Shari Redstone, and ,. Can Viacom finally move forward to address its operational and financial troubles? , All of the TV industry is facing challenges, but given MTV, Comedy Central and Nickelodeon’s youthful audiences, Viacom is feeling the effects of streaming bingeing and cord-cutting perhaps more acutely. There’s no easy fix here, and some fresh thinking is surely needed. The question is who will be put in charge permanently once Mr. Dooley’s interim stint is up at the end of the month., , ,The broadcast business enjoyed a ,, as upfront advertising sales ticked up for the first time in years. However, if you recall, last year’s ratings for the big networks tumbled during the September premiere week. Sure, several shows were able to demonstrate that they can deliver large audiences through on-demand windows. But TV’s big selling point is that it can accumulate large audiences in short windows of time better than anybody. With TV viewing habits , does anybody think shows like a “MacGyver” reboot or a “Lethal Weapon” remake are going to bring people home? Even tried-and-true live events like the Olympics and VMAs, which once guaranteed large captive audiences for advertisers, have shown signs of weakness. Will the NFL season fare better?, , ,The issue that few in the ad buying or selling world wanted to talk about this summer was rebates. ,Surely everyone’s been on their best behavior over the past few months. But you have to wonder whether we’ll see a slew of marketers switch agencies or advertisers cut back on nontransparent ad buying (like programmatic) in the coming months. The first step is just figuring out which agencies were even involved in the nontransparent practices., , ,We’ve seen some examples of , but the ad industry—like many industries—still has a long way to go to infuse their upper ranks with more females and minorities.

The question is how long it takes the combined company to fully ramp up., , ,For a while, it was easy to dismiss ad blocking as a fringe behavior—something popular among gamers and Europeans. But then awareness seemed to spread, with maybe your parents and neighbors at least knowing that ad-blocking software existed. The fact that estimates about the scope of ad-blocking vary wildly hasn’t helped calm fears among publishers and marketers. ,, while comScore a few months earlier had pegged the number at ,. It seems impossible to accurately gauge whether ad-blocker adoption has plateaued and become a manageable nuisance, or is about to snowball to the point that average consumers are evangelizing the practice. One thing’s for sure: It can’t be ignored., , ,On the web, this challenge has basically led to an explosion in branded content videos and articles that mimic the look and feel of a publisher’s site. And more and more marketers are cozying up to digital influencers to get their messages across in a way that speaks to younger consumers as more authentic. Meanwhile, on TV, companies like Turner are promising ,, as well as ,But will the average TV viewer notice any real difference?

Plus, most users are frustrated with them when they actually do load. Lots of companies are promising to fix this. Will we see any leaders emerge this fall?

HP Demands Ad Agencies Diversify Their Workforces,,"This copy is for your personal, non-commercial use only. To order presentation-ready copies for distribution to your colleagues, clients or customers visit http://www.djreprints.com.,http://www.wsj.com/articles/hp-demands-ad-agencies-diversify-their-workforces-1472820226,A recent spate of high-profile scandals on Madison Avenue involving accusations of sexist and racist behavior has put the spotlight back on the advertising industry’s lack of diversity. And now marketing clients are starting to leverage their budgets to insist on change., ,Antonio Lucio,, the chief marketing officer of , , sent a letter to HP’s advertising and public relations agencies on Thursday demanding that they improve the makeup of their workforces by hiring more women and minorities. Mr. Lucio, who previously spent years as marketing czar for , , has asked his agencies to come up with a plan to diversify their ranks within the next 12 months.,In the letter to HP’s five agencies, Mr. Lucio requested that each one submit a plan within 30 days that lays out how the firm will significantly increase the number of women and minorities in key creative and strategy roles.,“Including women and people of color in key roles is not only a values issue, but a significant business imperative,” the letter said.,HP’s agencies include Omnicom Group’s BBDO, Fred & Farid and , ,’s Gyro. It also uses two Omnicom PR firms. The technology company isn’t setting specific goals for each agency, but Mr. Lucio said he expects agencies to have 50% female representation, which is the gender makeup of HP’s marketing department.,If agencies don’t comply, Mr. Lucio said “anything is on the table,” including removal from HP’s roster.,HP, the personal computer and printer arm of the former Hewlett Packard Co., is putting pressure on its agencies to hire workforces representative of the broader population as the lack of diversity in industries from entertainment to technology becomes a hot-button issue. Madison Avenue has been grappling with the criticism for decades, but the issue has been reignited as of late after a, ,The chief communications officer of WPP’s J. Walter Thompson filed a harassment lawsuit against former CEO ,Gustavo Martinez,, earlier this year—charges he has denied.,Other incidents have included the recent , executive, ,Kevin Roberts,, following comments he made that were dismissive of the importance of gender diversity in the ad business. ,also stepped down in June after allegations of discriminatory behavior.,While ,, they represent only 11.5% of its creative directors, according to the 3% Conference, a movement dedicated to building a business case for more female creative directors in advertising. ,Overall the advertising business has a “poor score” on diversity, said Mr. Lucio. He added that the sector does have a “significant participation of women at the lower level” but has a problem with moving women up the ladder.,Mr. Lucio “knows about BBDO’s commitment to double the number of female senior creative leaders we have in one year and obviously supports it,” said ,Andrew Robertson,, BBDO’s chief executive officer. “His initiative to formalize an action plan on his business is something we welcome.”,Gyro Chief Executive Christoph Becker said HP’s demands “are critical, timely and something necessary in the industry.” Gryo has been working to improve its diversity, he added.,“Half of our global steering committee is now women, but we’ll not stop there: we want women to thrive at every level of the company,” Fred & Farid said in a statement. ,Palo Alto, Calif.-based HP isn’t the only firm to push for change. , , is requiring that creative agencies currently competing to win the food giant’s creative business must be staffed with at least 50% women and at least 20% people of color within the creative department. General Mills said that “agencies don’t need to be at that level today, but we will have meaningful conversations with our partners to ensure they understand the importance of this shared commitment.” ,earlier reported the General Mills news.,Some of the onus for change does lie with the marketing client, who should demand diversity at the agencies it hires because it will help them be more successful, argues former advertising executive and consultant Cindy Gallop. ,“Clients have the leverage because they are paying the fees,” she said this week on the ,. “I would love to see many more clients using that leverage because they have the power to transform our industry.”,Mr. Lucio couldn’t say why it’s taken so long for marketers to demand real change given that women control so much of household spending. He said that HP’s push for more diversity in the ad business was prompted in part by the fact that women buy 53% of personal computers and 45% of printers.,HP, is also holding itself accountable, saying it has been trying to improve the makeup of its own workforce. , since major companies like Facebook, LinkedIn and Google started publicly releasing , a couple of years ago that showed Silicon Valley workforces are short on women, African-American and Latinos in the upper ranks. ,HP said its doesn’t yet have any numbers on the diversity breakdown of its overall workforce since Hewlett-Packard Co. split last year. The company split into , , and HP Inc. last fall.,Before the separation, women made up 33% of Hewlett-Packard’s global workforce. The company at that time didn’t release the total number of minorities in its workforce.,HP’s global marketing team, which includes roughly 1,000 employees, is about 55% female and 30% of the staff consider themselves people of color, the company said.,“We are going to need to make much bigger progress among African-Americans and Latinos,” Mr. Lucio said., ,Suzanne Vranica at , ,

CMO Today: Philippe Dauman’s Last Act at Viacom,Mike Shields,"This copy is for your personal, non-commercial use only. To order presentation-ready copies for distribution to your colleagues, clients or customers visit http://www.djreprints.com.,http://www.wsj.com/articles/cmo-today-philippe-daumans-last-act-at-viacom-1472815790, ,: When , , and Sumner Redstone’s National Amusements ended their warfare and agreed to oust CEO ,Philippe Dauman,, his last act was going to be presenting a deal to the board to sell a stake in Paramount Pictures. Well, there isn’t any specific deal on the table and there won’t be a formal presentation in person. Instead, on Wednesday ,The Wall Street Journal reports. The deal memo effectively ends Mr. Dauman’s involvement in Viacom -- and his sale of some $60 million worth of stock in recent weeks underscores the point. A Paramount deal seems increasingly unlikely anytime soon, given how skeptical National Amusements has been about it. But the stake sale was viewed among investors as an obvious way for Viacom to raise much-needed cash. The way this saga has gone, who knows. , ,: Are some web browsers more ad fraud prone than others? A new study issued by the ad fraud detection firm , IE and Google’s Chrome had elevated ad fraud activity compared to other browsers, CMO Today reports. Over a seven day period in July, FraudLogix looked at 135 million individual online ad impressions, and 50% of those served to IE were determined to be “non-human.” That was the case with 20.5 % of the impressions served to Chrome. To be sure, both companies don’t agree with the study’s results -- they challenged the very methodology, saying that fraudulent “bots” can impersonate browsers, skewing the findings. Plus, it’s possible that fraudsters simply target the browsers with the broadest reach in the market. Mozilla’s Firefox, Apple’s Safari, and Microsoft Edge each recorded low levels of bogus impressions in the study. , ,: YouTube is letting some creators know that their videos are not safe for advertisers, and they are not happy about it. ,reports Ad Age. And that’s led big name creators like Phil Defranco--who got ads blocked from his recent video rant about political correctness--to speak out. By Thursday, the chorus of complaints had led to the hashtag #YouTubeisover to trend on Twitter. This isn’t a good look for YouTube, which has often weathered complaints from its creator community that its share of ad revenue is too high and its ad prices are too low. YouTube might argue that it’s been paying such creators for years and helped make them stars, but that’s a tough message to stuff into a hashtag. , ,: Twitter has been criticized for moving slowly when it comes to innovating on ad products. So it’s refreshing to see that it’s moving a bit faster with Periscope, its year-plus-old live streaming app. ,reports Variety. During the live streams, Mr. Roddick provided commentary on matches and engaged with fans on Periscope and Twitter, which also carried the live stream. As part of the initiative, the brands will promote the live streams with Promoted Tweet ads, and some sponsored highlight videos will be shared by the marketers and Mr. Roddick.

For advertisers this is bad news, since they can wind up paying for ads which can never actually be seen by real people.,To examine the role of browsers in this process, FraudLogix examined a sample of 135 million individual online ad impressions over a seven-day period in July, and analyzed the browsers to which the ads were served. The company also tracked the portion of those ads its technology deemed as delivered to “non-human” or “bot” traffic.,The browsers in which the most fraudulent impressions loaded were versions of Microsoft’s Internet Explorer browser and Google’s Chrome browser, the study found.,Some 50% of impressions served to Internet Explorer over the course of the study were to “non-human” traffic, FraudLogix said, compared with 20.5% of impressions served to Google’s Chrome browser.,Microsoft and Google each questioned FraudLogix’s methodology, saying it isn’t possible to accurately measure fraud at the browser level.,“Bots and malware often forge user agent strings to produce “fake” traffic, which can’t be attributed to a particular browser,” Microsoft said in a statement. ,Google said in a statement, “When malware infects someone’s device or web browser in general, the infected machine may act as a fraudulent bot impersonating any browser, even if it isn’t installed on the infected machine. As a result, we’ve found that measuring ad fraud per browser has not been a helpful way of understanding this issue.” ,FraudLogix Chief Executive Hagai Shechter acknowledged that infected computers may impersonate browsers, but said the company does not believe that happened in most instances it tracked during its study.,Instances of fraud are potentially higher for Chrome and Internet Explorer because of their widespread adoption, Mr. Shechter added. Other browsers might be more vulnerable, but they make less attractive targets because they have fewer users.,16.2% of the overall traffic FraudLogix examined was from Internet Explorer, compared with 61% from Chrome.,A recent study by the Association of National Advertisers estimated that advertisers could waste $7 billion this year on ads no people will ever see. Users may have little idea their browsers have been infected, since the webpages can be loaded in the background without them noticing.,Other browsers examined during the FraudLogix research included Mozilla’s Firefox, Apple’s Safari, and Microsoft’s newer browser, called Microsoft Edge.,Fewer than 5% of impressions delivered to all versions of those browsers were deemed fraudulent by FraudLogix.,Mr. Shechter said instances of fraudulent impressions were significantly lower for more recent versions of the Chrome browser, suggesting Google is successfully fixing “vulnerabilities” in its software. Many of the Chrome browser versions with the highest fraud rates are no longer supported by Google, and are used by a relatively small number of users.,“It seems like Google gets it, and that they’re addressing the vulnerabilities and the holes,” Mr. Shechter said.,With regard to Microsoft’s Internet Explorer, Mr. Shechter said he was surprised to see that one version of the browser, Internet Explorer 11.0, contributed the highest percentage of fake traffic overall.,That version of the browser has been discontinued, but is technically still supported by Microsoft. Because of that, “the security problems should be addressed and we’re just not seeing that,” Mr. Shechter said., ,Jack Marshall at , ,

Donald Trump’s candidacy was a sensation—you couldn’t not see him or hear him. In another way people have been paying attention for a quarter-century, which is how long Hillary Clinton and Mr. Trump have been famous in America.

The building supplies Gap and Banana Republic merchandise to online and store customers primarily in the Northeast and represents about 10% of the company’s nationwide warehouse capacity. A nearby building supplying Old Navy should reopen soon, the company said.,The cause of the blaze, which wasn’t fully under control until about 9:30 p.m. on Wednesday, hasn’t been determined, said ,Brandon Knapp,, chief of the Fishkill fire department. Mr. Knapp said that about 25% of the building was damaged beyond repair, while the remainder had significant smoke and water damage, and it could be weeks before inspections for insurance purposes are done.,The San Francisco retailer is in the midst of a sales slump and has been trying to turn itself around by revamping its merchandise to better compete with fast-fashion chains such as , , AB.

The company said it is also increasing its shipments from stores to compensate for lost capacity in Fishkill.,“While it will take time to understand the full impact and cause of the fire, we have contingency plans in place,” said ,Debbie Felix,, a company spokeswoman.,Many orders that would normally be filled out of the Fishkill facility are being handled by Gap’s distribution center in Gallatin, Tenn., according to an executive at one of Gap’s trucking service providers. Fishkill is still accepting inbound deliveries, but goods are being stored in trailers on-site, this person said., ,Mike Arnoff,, president of Arnoff Global Logistics in nearby Poughkeepsie, N.Y., said that Dutchess County officials had contacted him Wednesday on Gap’s behalf in an effort to compile a list of local firms that could assist with the situation.,Arnoff Global Logistics, which owns about 1.5 million square feet of warehouse space in upstate New York, said it might be able to find 100,000 square feet near the Fishkill facility and another 100,000 square feet in Albany, several hours away, to lease to Gap. He said Gap hadn’t contacted him directly.,“We would have to scramble” to find more space than that, Mr. Arnoff said., ,Robbie Whelan at , and Khadeeja Safdar at , ,

As companies become more dependent on complex software systems to manage their businesses, smoothly combining different platforms is becoming a bigger factor in a merger’s success.,New software systems for accounting, inventory tracking and supply-chain management are helping companies combine operations faster by automating some of the grunt work that previously was done manually. ,“If you can integrate faster, it becomes an advantage,” said ,John Hoffecker,, a global vice chairman at consulting firm AlixPartners LLP. ,Companies that integrate acquisitions more efficiently will be able to reap better returns from takeovers, which can in turn leave them more leeway to do future deals, Mr. Hoffecker said. “You can pay a higher price,” he said. ,Rev Group Inc., which manufactures emergency vehicles including ambulances and fire engines, has 30 different back-office operating systems strewn across 16 plants in the U.S., said Chief Executive Officer ,Tim Sullivan.,Before embarking on an acquisition push this year, the closely held company, which is based in Milwaukee, decided to streamline its business, which generates $2 billion a year in revenue, by bringing those plants onto the same system for accounting, inventory control and supply-chain management.,A team of employees and outside consultants finished shifting the first plant to the new system, designed by business-software maker , , Mr. Sullivan expects them to get the entire business on the same platform by 2017.,Although the work will cost as much as $25 million, the company expects to save $15 million a year after the project is completed, Mr. Sullivan said. The new software also will allow Rev Group to bring acquisitions on board much faster, and squeeze similar savings from those operations, which would accelerate the payoff from deals, he added.,The company announced in April that it would buy Kovatch Mobile Equipment Corp., which makes gear for emergency vehicles, fuel trucks and the military. Rev Group didn’t disclose terms of the deal. ,Corporate finance functions such as bookkeeping increasingly are automated. As the software becomes more sophisticated, it allows companies to reduce head count by performing routine tasks electronically, said ,Tom Willman,, an associate principal at consulting firm Hackett Group.,The number of full-time employees in corporate finance departments fell 1.6% last year and is expected to drop another 2.7% this year, according to a Hackett study of nearly 200 companies. ,Last week, , , said it planned , at its U.S. stores, because centralizing or automating those jobs was more efficient.,The burden of processing and tracking $3.5 billion a year in sales, with each sale averaging just $2,000, was keeping technology distributor , , from pursuing larger deals because of fears that adding more would tax aging software, said ,Charlie Mathis,, the company’s finance chief. Last year the Greenville, S.C., company began upgrading to a single platform to manage invoices and track inventory and expenses, among other functions.,Although 80% complete, the switch already has helped the company close larger acquisitions because the new software system can track more transactions than the older systems, Mr. Mathis said. ScanSource bought KBZ Communications Inc. last September for $61.5 million in cash.,“We weren’t sure we could take transactions over the bridge before, because it might have collapsed,” said Mr. Mathis. “Our M&A strategy goes hand-in-hand with the technology.”, ,Vipal Monga at , ,

To order presentation-ready copies for distribution to your colleagues, clients or customers visit http://www.djreprints.com.,http://www.wsj.com/articles/stability-of-a-sort-turkeys-islamic-bonds-1473040862,Those seeking to invest in Turkey following the recent coup attempt have options other than traditional stocks and bonds, thanks to Islamic entities known as participation banks that offer bonds with potentially greater upside and more stability than standard government debt.,Participation banks, subsidiaries of some of Turkey’s largest financial institutions, doubled their share of the country’s overall banking assets to about 5% between 2005 to 2015, according to a recent report from Standard & Poor’s. They did this by creating bonds based on profit-and-loss sharing, since Islamic law forbids making money through interest. This new asset class met the pent-up demand in the Muslim world for diversification beyond stocks.,“If you’re willing to take a little less liquidity for practically the same credit, you get paid more, and when things go south you have less downside,” says ,Ihab Salib,, portfolio manager of , ,,, which bills itself as a socially responsible fixed-income investment option that observes the Islamic prohibition on the giving and taking of interest. “The [Turkish] government wants these banks to thrive and have a bigger piece of the market going forward.”,Indeed, President ,Recep Tayyip Erdogan,’s support for further integration of Islamic law into all walks of Turkish life means participation banks are likely to grow. The system’s assets could reach some $300 billion by 2025, according to the Participation Banks Association of Turkey.,Mr. Salib says Islamic bonds are stable investments because they are offered through subsidiaries of larger banks. And since investors tend to buy and hold them, there is more stability in their prices, he says.,Islamic bonds are less liquid than conventional bonds, Mr. Salib says, and thus offer investors a yield premium over conventional bonds. However, Western financial institutions are considering incorporating Islamic bonds into some mainstream indexes, which could lead to higher prices and lower yields as they become more popular.,Participation banks are required to earmark a portion of their assets for projects that benefit local communities and businesses, meaning those looking for socially responsible investments also could be adopters of Islamic bonds., , ,

The Softening That Wasn’t,,"This copy is for your personal, non-commercial use only. To order presentation-ready copies for distribution to your colleagues, clients or customers visit http://www.djreprints.com.,http://www.wsj.com/articles/the-softening-that-wasnt-1473014451, , , , Welcome to “The Journal Editorial Report.” I’m Paul Gigot.,That was Donald Trump in Phoenix, Arizona, on Wednesday, doubling down on his hard-line position on illegal immigration, despite some recent suggestions he might be “softening”—that was his word—on his signature campaign issue. The speech followed a meeting with Mexican President Enrique Peña Nieto earlier in the day, where the Republican presidential candidate struck a more subdued tone, promising that a Trump administration would work with Mexico to secure the southern border.,Joining me on the panel this week, Wall Street Journal columnist Kim Strassel, assistant editorial page editor James Freeman, columnist, Mary Anastasia O’Grady and editorial board member Joe Rago.,Kim, let’s start it off by talking about the Mexican trip, which a lot of people in advance said was high-risk for Donald Trump. How do you think that turned out for him?, , I think that that was a good moment for Donald Trump, because, look, the point of this was to take this opportunity to go down and show that he had the ability to talk to a foreign leader, he had the temperament to go and do a negotiation. This is something that Hillary Clinton has hit him on hard, suggesting he’s not qualified. To go down there, not have any too big of an explosive moment, be able to do the photo-op and shake hands—that was arguably a good moment for Donald Trump., , Mary, you cover Mexico. You know all those folks down there. It didn’t play as well in Mexico, although I tend to think, for an American audience, I tend to agree with Kim. What do you think?, , I don’t think it was a good moment at all. In Mexico, President Peña Nieto is being called a traitor to his country for having met with Donald Trump. And I think even though the moment may have seemed diplomatic, the fact that he came back and basically sandbagged the Mexican president, I think is sending a signal to the world that this guy, if he becomes president, is not someone we can trust., , Now, the Mexican president did invite both Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump. And Donald Trump is the only one who took him up on it. I don’t understand why Hillary Clinton didn’t do it. It would seem to me she would want to do it, too., , I agree. I think it’s a better opportunity for Hillary Clinton. I think what was going on there is the Mexican president thought, if Trump is softening and he comes down here and we make some progress on a more reasonable, you know, relationship between the two countries, that he would get credit for it. And I think it backfired on him. And it may have worked well with Trump for his base but I think, for the Hispanics in this country, they didn’t like it at all., , I don’t know. It seemed to me one of the arguments, James, against Donald Trump that Hillary Clinton is making is that basically he can’t be—he can’t behave in polite company., ,Right., , He looked on stage—to me—with Peña Nieto, at least sober, gracious, respectful., , Yes. In the moment., , OK., , But the follow-up, I think, was devastating., , All right. Let’s talk about that follow-up., , I was going to say in the moment, just to disagree a bit, I thought he looked presidential. I thought it was also a great moment for Peña Nieto, even if there’s temporary domestic political blowback, because he was the statesman. He understands, this is their neighbor and he—whether it’s Trump, Clinton, he’s saying I understand we have a relationship, I want to work on it. I think he did the right thing.,The blowback. Now, I wish Donald Trump had just gotten on the plane with the bucket of Kentucky Fried Chicken, and flown back to New York and called it a day. Obviously, that didn’t happen that way. I think he seems to feel that he was sandbagged because Mr. Peña Nieto, after the meeting, said I’m not paying for the wall., , Right, which isn’t a surprise., , Not a surprise. Mr. Trump is making an unreasonable request of our neighbor to pay for a wall to keep some of our neighbors down south out. It’s a totally unreasonable request. So I think he did not react well. The moment was a triumph for Mr. Trump and I think from there it went downhill., , Let’s talk about the speech, Joe, and the immigration policy. We had 10 days of back and forth. We didn’t know—would he be softening, that was his word, his approach to immigration, would he not be? In the end, I read it as, no softening., ,Yeah, I think Trump has gone from point A to point A on immigration. He essentially embraced mass immigration—, , Mass deportation., , Mass deportation, excuse me, in a 10-point plan on all the security measures that he was going to take not only at the border but internal enforcement measures against businesses, e-verify, which is a dysfunctional program to kind of cross-check who has the right papers. And no incentive for people who are already here illegally to come out and have some kind of legal status going forward., , Kim, so on Joe’s point, I want to talk about the politics of this immigration speech, because it’s interesting to me—after you have that event in Mexico, come back and then you indicate you may be softening and then you don’t, what’s the politics, what’s the political calculation?, , Look, I think what he was trying to do with the Mexico trip, he’s trying to walk a very careful line here, Paul. He went down to Mexico in part to show himself to be presidential—, , Right., , —but also to say, look, I can work with this, I can negotiate. He’s trying to sort of appeal in that way to an Hispanic audience in United States and—, , What about the immigration. Why no change on immigration?, , It’s, I think, that this is a result of the blowback he got from many of his base supporters over the last week, which hammered him on the suggestion that he was going wobbly on his signature issue. That seems to have resonated in the end, and that seems to have informed that speech in the end, which I don’t see in any way how you can say was a softening, but was, in fact, kind of a more aggressive version of a lot of what he’s saying. It’s a very law-and-order Donald Trump speech., , Paul, Trump had something called Trump’s National Hispanic Advisory Council. One member resigned from it. One member came out and called the whole thing a scam., , After the speech?, , Yes. And Alfonso Aguilar, the president of the Latino Partnership for Conservative Principles, a really solid free-market conservative Hispanic, said that he’s inclined to pull his support from Trump., , James, quickly, do you think it was a success politically?, , No. And he’s running out of time to redefine here. But I think he’s got—I thought what he was doing was moving toward the sweet spot of we’re going to fight criminality and terrorism but we’re not going to limit legal immigration. And he missed an opportunity here., , Certainly the criminality came through loud and clear., , That was a big part of it., , OK.,Still ahead, as the presidential campaign kicks into high gear, polls show the race between Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump tightening, both nationally and in some key battleground states. What it means for the post-Labor Day sprint to the White House, when we come back., , As the candidates gear up for the post-Labor Day sprint to November, polls show the race for president is tightening, with the latest RealClearPolitics average giving Hillary Clinton a 4.5-point lead over Donald Trump nationally, down from almost eight points earlier this month. That lead shrinks to 3.9 points in a four-way race with Libertarian Party candidate Gary Johnson and Green Party candidate Jill Stein. And in some key swing states Trump appears to be chipping away at Clinton’s lead as well.,Ed Goeas is a Republican pollster and president of the Tarrance Group. He joins me now from Washington.,Ed, good to see you., , Good to see you, Paul. How are you?, , Good, thanks. What do you make of this Trump modest bounce?, , Well, it’s very interesting. I think everyone keeps looking for big movement in the race. Both candidates, if you look at the average of all the polling going back to the last year, both candidates have been working within a certain range—bandwidth, if you will—on the ballot. Hillary’s bandwidth is a little higher, Trump’s is lower. But as we have seen the fluctuations of the race, it’s come from Hillary bumping to the top of her range and Trump to the bottom or both being in the middle. Or as we’re seeing with the numbers, I think Hillary has been inching down towards the bottom of her range and Trump has had a couple of good weeks leading up to his speech in Arizona on immigration this week. So—, , On that point, Ed, I think what it looks to me like is Hillary Clinton’s favorables have been going down, and with that, her ballot test, back from the mid-40s to maybe upper 40s in some surveys, now back down. That’s the big change in the last two weeks., , Actually, the image of the two candidates is not changing much. Both started a year ago with a 55% unfavorable rating. If you look at the averages today, Hillary is at 54%, Trump is at 56% unfavorable. Those numbers are baked in. That’s what I mean about everybody keeps looking for big movements in the race., , Right., , I think the only potential for big movements to break out of that bandwidth that they’ve been in is the first debate, and that’s nearly a month away., , And is that—would that be in particular, Trump can improve his image as a potential president, is that the key test for him in the debate?, , I think as it’s, first of all, there’s not much expectation for the candidates to move their favorable/unfavorable rating but I do think you could see him bumping up towards the top of his range and her knocked to the bottom, or vice versa. But the bottom line, I think, is this race is, if you look at the numbers today, you mentioned 4.5 points—if you look at the race today, I believe that’s about where the race is. That’s kind of the center of them both being in the middle of their bandwidth., , Is this a race where one of the two candidates could win the presidency with 45% of the vote?, , It is, and that’s why you look at, I think you’re going to see everyone looking more and more at the four-way ballot., , Right., , The interesting thing about the four-way ballot is actually Hillary loses more. For example, the latest FOX News poll, she had a six-point lead on the two-way, and dropped to a two-point lead on the four-way. She loses more of that vote. And I think, where in the past, we’ve always kind of downplayed the four-way ballot, because those candidates in the fall tend to fade away., , Right., , Because the negatives are so high with both these candidates I think you’re going to see them driven to that point on the four-way ballot and, if not to vote for those candidates, they may well stay at home., , Well—, , And that’s when you see the numbers change., , OK. What puzzles me is that the vote for Gary Johnson, Libertarian, would be coming from Secretary Clinton. The Libertarian, you would think, would be taking votes away from the traditionally more free-market party, the Republican Party. Why do you think this might be happening, gaining votes from her in this election?, , Well, again, it’s coming from independents. It’s not coming from Democrats or Republicans. It’s coming from Independents, who have a 65% unfavorable rating of both these candidates. What you see is that Trump—in the four-way, Trump’s advantage with those independents shrinks because—because he’s also losing some of those independents. But in the case of Hillary Clinton, she has two places those independents can go. They can go to Stein or Johnson—, , Right., , —and that’s what’s happening. It’s not that all those votes are going to Johnson., , Do you see any chance that Trump can flip this where he comes up on top, other than maybe a sterling debate performance?, , You know, I have felt all along that there’s nothing in the numbers that says he can’t win this race. So that’s always an opportunity—that’s always going to be an opportunity for him. You know, he’s at a little bit of a disadvantage if you look at the numbers. But certainly he can come in to play. I think more and more, the focus is going to become the ground game. I was talking to someone this week about Hillary having 450 people on the ground for her campaign in Ohio, and with Trump, he’s depending on the national party. They have 100 people on the ground in Ohio for him. That could make three or four points difference on Election Day., , Yeah., , And if she has a superior turnout, these numbers all of a sudden become that much harder to overcome., , Does it look to you like Pennsylvania may be—which Trump targeted—increasingly out of reach for his campaign?, , Interesting, this week, RealClearPolitics moved it back into a toss-up on the presidential. And I think when you’re looking at the Senate race, the assumption in Pennsylvania, the assumption in New Hampshire is that as long as you keep the margin of the loss, if he loses those states, low they can overcome it with running a superior campaign, which, to date, they’ve been running very, very good campaigns, both in New Hampshire and in Pennsylvania., , All right. Ed Goeas, we’ll keep watching. Thanks for being here again. Hope to talk to you again before the election is over., , Thank you, as always, Paul. Thank you., , Still ahead, Hillary Clinton’s postconvention bounce may have flat-lined but one poll number in particular is rising for the Democratic presidential candidate. Find out what it is when we come back., , A milestone of sorts for Hillary Clinton as a new Washington Post poll shows 56% of Americans share an unfavorable impression of her, up six points in three weeks, and a new high for the former secretary of state. Donald Trump’s unfavorable rating is at 63% in the same survey, making them the two most unpopular presidential candidates in more than 30 years of polling.,We’re back with Kim Strassel, James Freeman, Mary Anastasia O’Grady, and Joe Rago.,James, you heard Ed Goeas—, , Yeah., , —say it’s winnable but Trump is trailing. Where do you see the race?, , He’s got it right where he wants it. No, in all seriousness, he’s trailing, as he has been for a while. Less of a deficit than before. When Kellyanne Conway joined this campaign, she said she would rather be in his position than Hillary Clinton’s. I think she would still say that. If you look at the upside that each candidate has going into the stretch here—normally when incumbents, and I think you have to consider her the incumbent because she’s the establishment figure running for an Obama third term, when they’re in the situation she is, they are in deep trouble. They often lose. Late deciders tend to give the new guy a try. His immigration speech aside, he’s actually had a good few weeks here of fairly disciplined message on the economy, on taxes. So I think he’s in a good spot and he’s better on TV than she is. He should win the debates., , I agree with you, but the change candidacy, all right? If an incumbent is polling as poorly as she is, the problem is you’ve got—the question is, can that challenger present himself as a tolerable president? Worth taking the risk? And that’s what Trump’s—the barrier Trump hasn’t gone over yet., , Well, Ed mentioned the ground game., , Right., , And Trump’s ground game is really weak. If you look at the number of offices she has opened compared to the number of offices he has opened in important states, he’s way behind. He says he’s going to catch up. Let’s take Florida, for example. She has 34 offices in Florida. He has one. What is he going to do to fix that? He’s going to use RVs. He’ll use three RVs. He’s going to put one down the—what is it—the I-4—, , I-4., , —corridor. And he’s got two others that are going to roam around the state. And the other part of their strategy there is registering voters. Maybe it’s going to work, but I think that’s a little bit of a stretch., , There is a real disconnect here in the just the breadth of the organization, Joe. Trump—Clinton is really a machine. They’ve got a lot set up. Trump isn’t raising much money. And he doesn’t have much of an organization., , No, it’s remarkable if you look at it. More money has been spent on this year’s Senate races than the presidential contest because Trump is not spending money on advertising. So that’s one thing I think he could do. I think a good Trump, a more professional Trump, could go a long way to close this gap. It’s advertising, organization, showing that he has a better temperament, tone, experience. If he does those things, I think he could make it more competitive., , Kim, on that point about performance, it does seem that a lot of people are giving Trump more credit for being a more consistent, more disciplined campaigner over the last couple weeks, as James suggested. Reading off the teleprompter, he’s not had any riffs that are getting him into trouble. Do you think that that is true and that’s—can that help him get over that barrier of people concluding that he is a plausible president?, , I think it’s been a stunning reversal, and he has had, as Ed Goeas said, a good couple of weeks leading up to the immigration speech. We’ll see what effect that immigration speech has on him. But he’s clearly—he brought in this new team. Clearly, has decided that he is going to act in a sort of presidential disciplined manner. I think the frustration for Trump supporters will be, in the end, if he does all of that and he does it perfectly and say he has a great debate performance, and in the end, it nonetheless comes down to the things that Joe was just talking about, and Mary, that he just doesn’t have the ground game because he didn’t do that investment, that’s going to be great knock for his supporters., , What a disappointment that would be for all of his supporters who were saying—he was telling them, look, I’m funding my own campaign, I don’t need to take money from all of these rich guys, and I’m a businessman, I know how to organize, and then to fail on something so fundamental to a presidential campaign., , Yeah. I think he’s got to write big checks at the end here, at a minimum, to keep faith with his supporters, and whatever he does after this to make sure they’re backing him. But you can also look at this the other way. She has been outspending, outadvertising, outorganizing him for weeks and weeks and months and months, and where is this race? It’s not working. The facts are bad for her. The American people don’t like the Clintons’ corruption, the dishonesty. Just this week, we learned the Clintons have taken $16 million from taxpayers to support them in postpresidential life. This is—, , James, that only means that she’s an incredibly beatable candidate. So why the heck is he so far behind?, , He’s not that far behind. I think she will be beaten., , All right, thank you all.,Still ahead, Hillary Clinton’s unfavorable numbers may be tough to turn around as her email woes continue to mount. We’ll have the latest in that ongoing investigation, next., , The FBI on Friday released a summary report of its probe into Hillary Clinton’s use of a private email server as well as the note from Clinton’s July 2 interview with agents. The documents reveal the former secretary of state could not recall any briefing or training by the State Department related to the retention of federal records or handling classified information. Mrs. Clinton also told the FBI that she did not recall receiving any emails she thought should not be on an unclassified system. The FBI notes that it was unable to track down all of the devices used by Clinton, making it impossible to know for sure whether her emails were hacked.,Tom Fitton is the president of the watchdog group Judicial Watch and author of the new book, “Clean House: Exposing Our Government’s Secrets and Lies.”,Welcome, Mr. Fitton., , Thank you, Paul., , You have now looked at the FBI report, as have I, and what is your biggest takeaway?, , Well, Mrs. Clinton’s remarkable lack of memory. Thirty to 40 times she says I don’t recall. At one point she blames the concussion she had near the end of her term, with perhaps her inability to recall briefings she should have received about whether or not she could be taking government records with her when she left office. She had a BlackBerry device that she kept in a sensitive part of the State Department, where BlackBerry and other computer devices like that are banned, because that’s where classified information is created, used and discussed. Then she blames everyone else in the State Department for the classified mishandling of documents, saying, well, if they’re on my system, I was relying on other people not to send me material that was classified., , Right., , But she admits she was a principal, who should have known about the handling of classified information and recognizing it, even if it wasn’t marked., , I will tell you one thing that stood out to me is that there’s—a record in there that Colin Powell warned her in an email at the beginning of her term that if she wasn’t careful and if she used the personal email, all of what she said could become federal records subject to the Federal Records Act. And instead of—I mean, sort of saying, OK, I better go on to not use my private server she went on to use her private server despite the warning., , And not only that, but Powell seems to suggest don’t tell anyone about it because if they find out about it they’re certainly going to point out that they’re government records. And, boy, if that isn’t an incentive for her and explains why she didn’t tell anyone about it outside the State Department. Frankly, it looks like she didn’t tell too many people about it inside the State Department because, according to the FBI, even her closest aides didn’t know about the private server until it became public. It’s unbelievable.,But the other big thing is that after the email scandal was broken by the New York Times, her emails were deleted., , Right., , And there was a meeting with her lawyer, David Kendall, between—that involved the person who deleted the emails, whose name we don’t know, and David Kendall, and they were asked about what went on at that meeting and attorney/client privilege was cited and no one got an answer., , Now, there’s also, the report says, 17,448 work-related emails that she and her lawyers did not turn over to the State Department. Are those the emails that, in fact, you have been trying to get a hold of in your Freedom of Information Act requests?, , Yeah. That’s curious because now, you know, it answers a question perhaps, because we’ve been told there are 14,900 emails sent or received that she didn’t turn over., , I thought I had seen that number 15,000 or so. This is a different number. It’s even more., , There’s a second disk that has classified material. So I’m wondering if the difference between those two numbers—is the 2,000 or so on that second disk, are there 2,000 records that are classified that were deleted by Mrs. Clinton? It seems to suggest some of them were., , To suggest—we will probably never see what was deleted, right? The FBI says we don’t have that, we don’t have access. They didn’t get access to the archive server and so they probably can never get those back., , No. They talk about the archive computer being mailed and being lost, her having 13 devices, which is probably a world record even in this day and age. I know we like to upgrade our devices quickly, but 13? And so much for convenience, if you need 13 devices and you’re going through 13 devices.,What comes across here, Paul, is that this is a pretty big operation. And they spent a lot of time moving records around. And once it became known that she had the records, removing them and deleting them, and then making sure they were really deleted. The FBI really blew it on this one. And a lot of the questioning avoided a lot of elephants in the room related to records retention and their obligation us under law there and the Federal Records Act and Freedom of Information Act. And the pass on the classified information is readily apparent. Mrs. Clinton thinks she’s a law unto her herself when it comes to classified information. It’s remarkable., , And the purpose of this, in your view—and we don’t have a lot of time here—was to disguise what emails—make sure that the public would not see any communication she might have had with the Clinton Foundation, for example, and politically related emails., , You know, there’s this big lie, I think, in Washington or a big falsehood that the coverup is worse than the crime. There’s usually something to cover up, and we’re seeing in these email releases she didn’t want access to any of her personal emails because they documented, you know, Benghazi guilty knowledge and these “pay to play” connections with the foundation, for sure., , Finally, Tom, how many more emails do you think will come out here between now and the election?, , Oh, I think several thousand. The governments is going to have to tell us in the middle of September where—when are we going to get these 14,900 evidently the FBI recovered. So they will be coming out over the next few months, and it’s just a question of how quickly the courts force the government to move and the Obama administration to move., , All right. Thank you for being here., , You’re welcome., , Still ahead, ObamaCare makes a return to the campaign trail. With rising premiums and shrinking options, could the controversial law help Republicans keep control of the Senate?, , Is ObamaCare making a return to the campaign trail? With health-plan choices shrinking and premiums soaring ahead of November’s open-enrollment period, the controversial Affordable Care Act may be a defining issue in some key Senate races this fall.,Here’s an ad running in Arizona, where Republican Senator John McCain is locked in a tight race with Democratic Congresswoman Ann Kirkpatrick., , , , , , , , , All right, Joe, no doubt about where McCain thinks he can win on that. That’s the—between now and November, what new are we likely to learn about the Affordable Care Act?, , Well, we’ll get final premium rate increases. Right now, they’re just submissions to state regulators. It’s about 18% to 22% on average nationally., , For one year?, , That’s for one year. You have a McKinsey study this week saying that the average lowest rate increase is going to be 11%. So you’re really having some serious problems with these exchanges.,I think health care has receded a bit in recent years as a political issue because Republicans can’t do anything about it as long as President Obama is in office. Now that’s changing, and I think it’s re-emerging as a real flash point in this election., , What about the choices? Because there’s a new Kaiser study showing that 31% of the counties in the United States are now only going to have one insurer in the ObamaCare exchanges. Is this lack of choice becoming an issue?, , Yeah, I think it is. In Arizona, for example, there’s several counties where there are zero insurers selling any kind of ObamaCare policies. You’ve got a big withdrawal of the major insurers. It’s really down to kind of Medicaid contractors who are selling these plans, low quality, very narrow network of doctors and hospitals. And just not what people have come to expect from normal private insurance. So it’s becoming an issue in people’s lives. And that naturally comes into politics., , Mary?, ,Well, I mean, I think one of the—you mentioned the 31% of the counties in the United States. Another statistic that came out of that same study is that almost 60% of the counties will only have two insurers. As Joe was mentioning, the withdrawal of these companies, which can’t make money in these places because of the rules in the ObamaCare, is leaving Americans with very little choice. And of course, when you don’t have choice, that pushes up prices., , Kim, on the politics of this, for example, in the Indiana race, Chuck Schumer, Democrat, recruited Evan Bayh to run in Indiana, thinking he would have a pretty free run, but Evan Bayh voted for ObamaCare and decided not to run in 2010, when that was such a contentious issue. But now that vote he made back then is going to come back here and become an issue. Are Republicans ready to make that an issue?, , Yes, his competitor out there, Todd Young, is already hitting him on this, talking about how he was a deciding vote for ObamaCare back in 2010, trying to make him responsible for that vote, and talking up his own reform alternatives to ObamaCare. You have seen this play out in several states where there are people—in Wisconsin, for instance, Russ Feingold voted for ObamaCare., , Right., , Out in Colorado, Michael Bennet was one who voted for ObamaCare. The competitors are definitely trying to hold their feet to the fire on that and think that it could be a defining issue.,What’s also notable about the Senate races, too, Paul, aside from actually having some Democrats who voted for the bill, it so happens that some of the states being worst hit by the law—like Arizona, like North Carolina—just happen to be places where there are very competitive Senate races. And you are seeing the Republicans really move aggressively attempt to make it a defining issue., , All right, Kim, so how are the Democrats responding to this? Because a lot of them once had thought, well, this would be a great, like most entitlements, and work for us down the road. Are they defending it, are they saying it’s the proudest vote I’ve made, or are they walking away from it?, , Some of them are walking away from it. What you’re beginning to see, like what just happened in Florida, too, is a lot of pressure on Democrats to say what they would do. And I’m not really sure this is going to work for them. Like in Florida, for instance, Patrick Murphy, Democrat running against Marco Rubio—his solution for what you would do is he said we need a public option., , Right. That’s where they’re falling out., , Yes. And that’s where a number of them—and Hillary Clinton has said that as well, too. I don’t think that necessarily helps them. Republicans are saying: Look, you’re going to make a bad situation worse. And they’re really jumping on that in an aggressive offensive way, too., , The public option, is that the savior for the Democrats?, , More government control. You know, there was a—, , I’m sorry. Pardon the interruption. Huge step toward national health care if it passed., , Right. And disaster. ObamaCare has already run kind of public option lite. We got those evil private—public—excuse me, private corporations out of the business, they ran these co-ops, they have failed all over the country. You took away the profit motive, patients didn’t benefit. Taxpayers obviously didn’t either.,It’s hard to call this a sleeper issue because, obviously, its failures are manifest, but it is a problem. You look at Russ Feingold in Wisconsin—he has spent years pretending that it’s working. It’s not. It’s a problem for him., , All right. Thank you all.,Still ahead, this Labor Day, a look at the state of the American economy and disturbing new data about the plight of working age men in America., , With Labor Day weekend upon us, a look now at the state of the American economy and the workforce, and some disturbing new data from political economist Nicholas Eberstadt. In a Wall Street Journal op-ed Friday, Eberstadt argues that America is now home to a vast army of jobless men, noting that there are roughly seven million between ages 25 and 55 who are not only unemployed but no longer even looking for work.,So, Mary, you want to get to Eberstadt, but let’s step back. Got the jobs number this week. Kind of a mediocre number, 50,000 new jobs. Where are we in terms of the economy?, , First of all, we’re in the late stages of a very long recovery, but it’s been very tepid. We haven’t grown very fast. I think that basically if you want to try to understand what’s happening in the labor market, looking at unemployment is as helpful as looking at the employment rate, in other words, the number of people who are actually participating and at wages. And in both those counts, the number of people participating, who are able-bodied people, who are actually either looking for work or working, is at the lowest level it’s been since the late 1970s. And wages have not been growing. And fundamentally, that comes down to productivity because productivity is a jargon word but it really means output per worker. And you can’t have wages going up if output per worker isn’t going up., , And that means investment—, , Exactly., , —to drive technological change and new innovation., , Right. And that decline in productivity we’re seeing is happening at the same time you’ve had this terrible business investment environment. It seems weird. We see stocks at high levels. But when you look at the level of the company, they are not investing in new plants, new equipment, technology, all those things that allow people to produce more and get paid more. Obviously, Friday, we saw the employment numbers basically follow the bad GDP numbers. It’s a slow-growth economy. It’s a limited-opportunity economy., , As a political matter, Joe, this—let’s take the factors. I think benefiting Clinton would be low gasoline prices, which is often a political hot button. You have low inflation. The economy is growing, no recession. On the other hand, you’ve had such mediocre wage growth and slow growth, so it’s hard to know politically who is going to benefit from the economy., , Yeah. The other thing I would throw in is you have a low unemployment rate. The flip side is that the rate is low because a lot of people have left the workforce and just are no longer participating in the economy. I would give a slight political advantage to Trump on the state of things. This would normally be a change election. Now, can he prosecute the economic case? We really haven’t seen that so far., , What you mean by that is make the case: Here’s what’s happening, here’s why you haven’t had the growth in wage increases, here’s why policies aren’t working, and here is my better alternative. That’s not the thing he typically does., , Right. He’s not saying look what ObamaCare regulations are doing to the labor market and pushing people into part-time work. He’s not saying here’s why energy regulations are preventing the business investment that we’re talking about., , He’s mentioned those things from time to time, but he has trouble staying on message. And another giant problem is that he is against free trade, and free trade is a very important part of the engine of growth., , All right, Kim, let’s talk about the Eberstadt numbers. The figures are striking with all these men out of the workforce. These guys are Rago’s and Freeman’s age. Unfortunately, I think I’m out of that demographic, so we have to work even harder. What about those numbers? They’re really dispiriting when you look at them., , Yeah. He calls this an out-and-out crisis, and points out there are basically, as a percentage of the population, more able-bodied men not working, not even actively seeking work, than any time since basically following World War II. And moreover, what they’re doing—and they fall into certain demographics and types of people as well too. It’s often African-Americans, for instance. And they’re not using their time when they’re not working very gainfully either. They’re proving to be a drag on society. So it is a very bleak situation and one that hasn’t been talked about enough. And I think that’s why he’s highlighting it because he says it’s a crisis., , I think some of these people are workers who may have lost their jobs, don’t have the skills in a changing economy to adapt, it’s not their fault. But what role has government played here?, , I think another factor we haven’t talked about yet is we’ve seen a decline in new business creation, the creation of new employers to hire these people, and I think that is really a much better way to solve an issue of someone not having the skills or their old company fading away. We’re not creating the new businesses. And this is the “you didn’t build that” culture that President Obama has presided over for years. And I would say Mr. Trump has really laid out some compelling ideas on tax reform and regulation in terms of allowing that business creation, getting the government off the back of particularly small business.,Another point, the NFIB numbers, small business is hurting more than big businesses, so I think that’s a focus, and that’s what he’s pointing up., , All right.,We have to take one more break. When we come back, “Hits and Misses” of the week., , Time now for our “Hits and Misses” of the week. Kim, start us off., , Paul, this is it a big miss to the Supreme Court refusing to reinstate North Carolina’s voter ID law, thereby robbing that state of the comfort of knowing they have some integrity at their polls at this upcoming election. This is a reminder of how important the Supreme Court is in this upcoming presidential race. The ID law they refused to reinstate is not much different than ones the court has up held in the past. The only thing that’s changed is that Antonin Scalia has passed away. So another reminder of the stakes., , All right, thanks, Kim. Joe?, , Paul, another big miss to the European Union for rewriting Ireland’s tax law to charge Apple $14 billion in retroactive taxes. Apple complied with the law, but the EU decided that Ireland’s corporate tax rate was too low and, therefore, a subsidy. This is an attack on tax competitiveness and tax competition between countries. And if you want to know why British voters decided to leave the EU, here it is. Maybe Apple should be next., , All right, thanks, Joe. Mary?, , This is a hit for the people of Venezuela. On Thursday, a million people turned out on the streets of Caracas, many of them traveling from other cities around the country, to ask the military dictatorship to abide by the constitution and allow a recall referendum—to judge the president, whether the people want him or to say, no, he should be recalled before the end of the year. It’s very important it’s done before the end of the year, because if it’s done next year, he can pass the torch to his vice president. And Venezuela needs change and the people of Venezuela deserve a lot of credit for taking to the street., , James?, , A hit to Mother Teresa being canonized as a saint this weekend by the Catholic Church—provided an inspiring example for the people around the world with her work with the poor in the slums of Calcutta. Shared a message of hope, faith and love, and really just a life of service rather than condemning people for the sins of global warming, for example., , All right, James, thank you.,That’s it for this week’s show. Thanks to my panel and thanks to all of you for watching. I’m Paul Gigot. Hope to see you right here next week.,

"Global Economy Week Ahead: Central Bankers’ Outlooks, ECB Bond Buys, China Inflation",,"Central bankers take center stage this week as officials from the Bank of Japan and the U.S. Federal Reserve give closely watched speeches ahead of policy meetings later this month.
